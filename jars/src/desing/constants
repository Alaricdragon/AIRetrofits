need to create constants for everything. this will make files and data easier to track.
adding new rules for adding new constants, to avoid being frustrated with how many of them i have.
currently in:
AIWorldCode - > industries -> base
going down through AIWorldCode. hope to get everything done soon
they must:
    1.a) be used, or potentially be useful, in more then one location.
    OR
    1.b) have simpler other data in other classes, that i might want to be able to compare in a time efficient manner.
    OR
    1.c) have a complicated setup, were changing the variables or arrays could completely change the the way the code works,
         and i might have need to change it someday.

they must not:
    1) have there data stored elsewhere
not yet meeting requirements:
    AIRetrofit_AIretrofit
    AIRetrofit_AutomatedCrewReplacementDrones
    AIRetrofit_IndustryBase
    AIRetrofit_AINodeProductionFacility
    AIRetrofit_roboticMaintenanceFacility
    AIRetrofit_syntheticProductionCenter
    AIRetrofit_combatRobotManufactory
    AIRetrofit_PersonalRobotManufactoryBase
    AIRetrofit_salvageRobotManufactory
    AIRetrofit_surveyRobotManufactory

going to do latter for:
    AIRetrofits_AILudicWar
    AIRetrofits_BrokenAIWorkers
    AIRetrofits_LudicPathWatchers
    AIRetrofits_PurgingAIWorld
    AIRetrofits_UnbrokenAIWorkers

    AIRetrofit_AIRelations
    AIRetrofit_TransferMarket
    reasons: i dont even know if they work or not....

going to abstain for:
    AIRetrofits_Startup_CrewReplacer,
    AIRetrofits_Startup_MarketRetrofits
    AIRetrofits_Startup_RobotForge

    reason? they already get stored in there resepective areas, having them also be a globule constant will not help me here.

    AIRetrofit_Dialog_ForgeItemAndSelection
    AIRetrofits_RobotForge
    AIRetrofits_RobotForgeDiologPlugin

    reasons? messy, and i hope to never look at it again.

    AIRetrofit_robotCarrierService

    reasons? not used. might never be used.
partly did for (because they only needed some of the data)
    AIRetrofit_roboticPopFactoryV1
    AIRetrofit_roboticPopFactoryV2
    AIRetrofit_AIRetrofitPurgeOption
    AIRetrofit_shipYard
