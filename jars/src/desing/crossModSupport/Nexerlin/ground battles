ground units and nexerlin:
so back in the day, when i first asked Histidine to add crew replacer support for nexerlin ground battles. when they shoued me the
thing, something interesting happend. and i hand that back.
the ground units formed by my robots, were my robots. i loved this. it was the fucking best thing ever. my favorut thing ever. i love love love it.
thats gone now. replaced with a mush more powerful system one i intend to use to swap out all ground combatants in in a combat. im going to use it for my robots. but first thing first:

the base ground combatants:
"marine": represent the basic combatants in a ground battle. player made.
    str: normal
    cost: normal
    morale: normal
    def: normal
"heavy": represents the heavy guns in the ground battle. like artilary and tanks
    str: high
    cost: very high
    morale: normal
    def: normal
"militia": represents the basic people of the world, (not the milatary, but armed civs) entering the battle
    str: low
    cost: NA
    morale: low
    def: normal
"rebel": represents anti goverment ground forces entering the battle, to retake the world for there own reasons.
    str: low
    cost: NA
    morale: low
    def: high

i want to replace each one of said ground combatants with one of my own for each tier of robot. i have a few options for this:
option 1: make each tier of robot have strangth equal to there robot strangth.
    example: T0 robot have 2X the numbers, but 0.5X the strength.
option 2: make each tier of robot have different strengths and weaknesses
    example: T0 robots being very weak, but high numbers, and T0 'heavy' robots being very tanky, but with only mid damage?

mmmm

for now though, let us talk about what robots will be deployed when:
idealogagy:
    note: this is talking about what i should do with each unit in each situation. just a basic overview, so i dont stray to far away from what i might want to.
    attacking:
        marine: in a attack, marines are the forces brought with into battle. this means i was willing to bouth transport them, and to attack someones base with them.
        heavy: in a attack, heavy is a considerable investment. if i brough them into battle, i was willing to transport them, be seen with them, and invest the resorses to make em fight.
    defending:
        marine: in a defence, this is the standing forces of a army that you have ready to repell a attack.
        heavy: --
        militia: in a defence, this is the forces that i was hastely armed and armored for the reasons of defending my base. i must keep that in mind
        rebel: in a defence, this is my own forces that were turned on me. i must keep this in mind.

ideology of deploying high level robots:
    high level robots are hard to produce and rare. i feel like it should be possible to deploy a lot of them, but at a cost.
    let the amount of alpha level robots be: total robot output across all worlds.
    let the amount of places robots need to be: total population size?
        -maybe change this to something like 'total number of military bases? make each miltary base want a few high level bots, provided they exist?

    ok, new plan:
    lets decide how we are going to organize this today. because high tier robots are highly valuable, so i think i need a solution
    so lets look at the effect of each robot forge of each level on the factions total defences?

    robot forges effects:
        T0 robot forge:
            notes:
                T0 robot forges always have only provided robots to the player (mostly). i might be able to stretch it to it also provides for the players world its built on. so lets keep that theam.
            base:
                does nothing here.
            gamma:
                improves player robot output. nothing more here.
            beta:
                in a attack, does nothing, but in a defence, replaces a percent of player defences equal to its defence multi.
                (this eq:)(DM-1)/DM.
                so if i have a defence multi of 1.1, (increase of 10 percent more defneces) i would have 0.1/1.1 of my defence troops replaced by basic robots.
            alpha:
                in a defence, replaces 1% of forces per output with alpha robots.
                in a attack, replaces 1% of forces per output with alpha robots.
                the reasoning for this i feel, is that i could easily see the world picking up a few robots for a assault, provided there was some extra. or having a few fresh out of the factory to use as defenders.
            [REDACTED]:
                the same as alpha. this must be kept rare, or it can really mess things up.
        T1 robot forge:
            base:
                does nothing here.
            gamma:
                does nothing here.
            beta:
                with the improved industry level of output from the forge, i feel like it would produce more?
                i need to check the code, but i might change this so there is more defencive robots in this case,
                because at that ponit, you are puting a industry onto defending your world. so there should be a LOT of robots ready to defend.

                OOOOO i have a idea. maybe i could have this also effect malita? have a normal robot malita, that kinda sucks,
                 but make this one a little stronger. so there is a extra reason to have this factory up and running.
            alpha:
                this is were it gets interesting. and we need to talk about something i have been thining off:
                i have the idea, that if a faction had acsess to even a small amount of robots of this type, they would fucking use them.
                this is a extremely powerful resource. so:
                every military base and high command will demand 1 alpha bot per 5 marine output (or maybe every world will demand 1 alpha bot per 5 marine supply? mmmmm), up to the max output of the faction.
                for every -calculated- demand of alpha bot present anywhere, create one 'cost'. (NOTE: this is not using the actual demand, because them it creates a case were you dont want your robot forge worlds to grow, because then the 'cost' will go up grammatical.)
                also make it so every missing supply of a alpha bot creates 2 'cost' (so if you lose a shipment from raiding, it hurts more).
                for every output of alpha bot from a T1 robot forge, create one 'supply'
                now, in EVERY combat engagement, both attack and defence, swap out anything lower tier for a alpha robot provided random 1 is greater then: ((supply / demand) * 0.5)
                this would also effect militia, and rebels? as more advanced combat units resolts in them being used more
            [REDACTED]:
                the same as alpha, but it would use the [VERY FUCKING REDACTED] instead. also, it would have its own set of supply and demand. because why the flipy flip not?
                for real though, thejksfkakjsdcfnvm sz

    i need to decide on how the combat units are going to act on various levels, now they they will all (in theory) be usable
    T0:
        notes: the T0 robot always has been a bit of a peace of scrap. easy to make and mantain, lots of pew pew, but low combat ability.
        let this reflect that
        marine:
            notes: deploying this robot in swames should have always been the way. i like it. but it requires more moral. and testing to make sure im not gimping my players.

        heavy:
            image: a mush thicker robot? maybe like some type of multi-bot? multibull robots merged together i mean?
            notes: I have a few ideas for heavy units. so i might need to return to this idea. but let me list them here:
                a: make it like the normal heavy wepon, but with the same mods the marine of T0 has.
                b: make it some type of heavyly armerd big boy.
                    -issues:
                        balance.
                        more armer and less firepower might just make it worse do to the way math goes (also make ground battles -LONGER- wish sucks).
                        -... youknow, there might be a spot to use this. have a third button added to the game that makes 'big boys'. have the option to deploy some heave armor, provided you have the
                         robots and metals to do it. it could be interesting to add a third unit.

            notes:
                this is simple enouth. but i have a idea.
                why not make this desing based around the salvage robot instead of the combat robot? it could be interesting. having
                a salvage robot that just shows up at some ponit. would be coooooolllll. also would give cadance to the idea of having the 'malita' be part combat robots being a good thing, instead of baaaaddd

                i want rebels to be just like malita. like the same basicly. they already are in the base mod, but they have a higher defence. so what could i do that matches that?
                ...
                i would need to think about that.

    T1:
        notes: 0.75, 1.25. mush stronger them T1 robots. since they should be rare, they should relfect this strangth.
        there is only one issue: the possability of 'increaseing' the combat strangth of a force by more then the player wants. having the
        numbers be all wrong like that does not sound fun....
        marine:
            image: T2 robot.

            notes:
                god, the thihngs i could do here...
                so something to keep in mind is that T1 combat robots are, to put it bluntly, a powerhouse. they are fucking strong.
                they are also not able to be built without a [DATA_EXPUNGED] so having the 'heavy' form of them be cool as f*uck is something thats ok.
                so, if i keep in the possable theam of 'big robots' how would i like to do this? they are a bit floaty by nature, so i might have to do something with that.
                a floating gundom? i am joking. proboly something more akin to a floating tank of some sort. something a bit stange though, but not very..
                what would this units stats even look like?

lets take some time to talk about the supply and demand concept.
but first backstory: the chance of a certen type of robot replaceing a 'base' unit (marines, heavy wepon, milita, rebel) is if random(1) < chance.
so 1 is 100% of the time. 0 is never.
so what should provide supply were (attacking, defending, attacking local, defending local)?
so:
T0 factory's should -NEVER- provide faction wide supply. only local.
all C-factorys with a beta core should provide 0.5X the attacking local supply.
all C-factorys with a beta core should provide there local supply into the malita as well, replacing them with themselves.
all T1 factorys should provide faction supply in some way.

should T1 non C-Factorys provide faction wide supply? its something to think about.
    -on one hand, it goes into the idea of the faction useing said bots....
    -although i suppose beta core mods in survey and salvage bots indecate more bots being on the world. maybe keep the basic rules for them...? i dont know...
T1 and T2 bots should be hard to compleatly fill out your supply with (so you cant have 100% advanced combat robots -easy-). it should still be possable though.

T0 bots should be easier to end up with a faction supply, because they are junk. literal junk.
T1 and T2 bots should be a bit harder, but maybe this is already done, do to the fact the alpha cores and [DATA_EXPUNGED] are quire rare.
so:

T0 factory:
    attack:
    defence:
