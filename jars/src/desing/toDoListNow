to do list:
NEW PLAN:
    reroot all effort into makeing this bare bones workable so i can play Starsector with it.
    requirements:
        1) (DONE) fix rules CSV file
        2) (DONE) reset all industry stats to required amounts.
        3) (DONE) add support for new crew replacer jobs and nex invasion job.
    wants:
        1) (DONE)add all not yet added options (market growth) to settings.
        2) (DONE)fix up non rules.csv bugs in founding markets.
        3) fix the rest of the to do list.
        4) make manufactures output resources.
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
            if i remove the building, the sub-market will vanish. this will destroy all ships in said submarket.
             -solution: add a way to move the ships from the shipyard submarket to the storage submarket.
             -ACTIVE TEMP solution:
                1) prevent shipyard code from running when the industry is not present
                2) prevent the upmarket from being removed when there are ships inside of it
    questions:
        how to make an industry send resources to your supply point
        how to add text prosaically to an item

market:
    (started)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (not possable?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Combatability:
    -(done. not tested)add code to make it so you get the robotforge hullmod/skill, and AIRetrofits hullmod when you have AIRetrofits and don't have said hullmods and ability.

Robots:
    -add an extra part to there description that shows:
        -size
        -crew-power.
        -(this is done for weapons. it can be done here.)
    -change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -finish the repairs to the hullmod, fixing the last weirdness of its description
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.

AI Market plugin:
    Important: Note: the guy who made nex contacted me and we talked about the CSV file a little. he said the the lake of conditions in one of
                     my rules might be causing issues. reference the discord conversation for details
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the randomly not working nature of the plugin.
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact you cant click on the plugin at random times, and need to spam click it to get it to work
        -why?
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
