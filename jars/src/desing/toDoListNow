doing right now: Sub Command Node thigs. look at the to do here.
im going to work on the following now:
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(done)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
        Command Node and relevant industry:
            questions:
                is it possible to get a list of the skills that a randomly generated officer / admin can spawn with / gain as they level up?
                how do i get the possible officer personality from a fleet doctrine? i tried doctrine.getAggression(), only to realize that aggression 4 includes both aggressive and reckless officers, and i want my code to be future proof in case more aggression levels have a mix of possible personality.
                what are the different costs a given admin or officer has to buy at different levels?
            (almost done)SpecialItem:
                NOTE: possible issue with were this is placed maybe. we will find out at some point. might need to be stored in a certain folder or location to work right?
                (done)apply skill, name, and personality data to item.
                (done)display skill, name and personality data on item.
                (done)right click item to add person to your fleet / admin pull.
                (done)add everything this items needs to special items
                (done)make items save there data.
                (moved this issue to people maker)data is not randomized right. wrong number of skills, level, and everything else.
                (done)stop the command nodes from stacking why are they like this!?!?
                (to do:) find out the costs of people at diffrent skill levels. so i can get diffrent item costs for stronger people.
            CreatePeople:
                make it so i can get an officer or a admin with skills based on a single power stat.
                    -officers level cost should be liner. the elet skill cost should cost maybe 150% a normal skill.
                    -officers should be soft caped for eleet skills and total skills based on the players skill level
                    -officers that are given -a lot- of power should be able to have an skill level or total level higher then the max (should be like 5X more power per skill or something).
                    -admins should have an expenses increase in power requirements per skill added to them
                make it so officer personality can be better based on a factions possibly personality.
                make it possable to have agents (nexerlion) spawn.
            (started)Submarket:
                (done)add to csv
                add image
                add text.
                (done)make the market refuse to bye things.
                (done)make the market only sell command nodes.
                (almost done)allow the market to have diffrent strangths on command nodes.
                    -need to fix the 'create officer' code.
                    -need to build the 'add skills to admin' code
                (Cores done. improvements not.)allow AICores and improvements to change the submarkets AICore stats
                (done)make it so the submarket is added and removed with the industry
                change description of the industry to say it adds this sub market.
                (done)change what the AI cores do on said industry.
                (dine)make it so the sub market A does not exist, or B does not refresh well in industry is offline
                update the old exstra text in this submarket ()
                (done. untested.)make it so the number of core and total power is based on the amount of sub command node supply, and not something else.

                notes:
                    i have made it so the sub market resets cargo every time you visit it. make it not do that before release.
                    commandNode needs to have its logs set to only output when they are required.
                issue:
                    depending on what i make improvements do, i might need to change the text that shows how strong a given industry is.
            AICore Changes:
            CreatePeople to do list:
                1) make it so i can get officers and admins, based of the power stat (using said stat to set level and number of special skills.)
                2) make the constants for making random people have links to the config and also make sense.
NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.

robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.

missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
