to do list:
ask questions on forum (done. wait for reply):
    how to make an industry send resources to your supply point
    how to add text prosaically to an item (like marines)
    how to change a items images (like crew and marries) as it changes in quantity

images:
    start to work on images. and what they are.
    i want to open with the salvage, survey, and combat robots, then item, then industrys.
    this is -required- to be finished.
    also me want images.
    please me. rework the way salvage and survey bots look.
    combat bots can get a rework latter.
    created images file for ideas.
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
            when the industry is not functional, there needs to be text showing it will not work.
            when the industry is not on a player owned world, it should cost credits to retrofit ships.
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.

    robotic replacement thing:
        work and design something as a temporarily thing.
    Manufactures of all type

market:
    (started)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (moved this idea over to market retrofits?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Robots:
    -add an extra part to there description that shows:
        -size
        -crew-power.
        -(this is done for weapons. it can be done here.)
    -change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certen data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
