NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.

robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.

missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
