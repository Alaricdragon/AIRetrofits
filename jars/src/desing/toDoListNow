Ground battle unit defs are now moddable, can add new ones or modify existing ones in data/config/exerelin/groundBattleDefs.json
Player can create units with modded unit types if the unit def allows it
NPCs will use default ground units, use a GroundBattleListener to add or replace units as necessary
    in GroundBattleListiner: InvasionIntel.from to ge the market in from.
    in groundBattleDefs.json, you gotta scrol down a little to get to the part about troop types.
questions:
    (for nexerlins deeluper):
    in regards to invasions and the groundBattleDefs.json
    so i have been exsperamenting with the groundBattleDefs.json and have some questions/ bug reports:
    questions:
        1) in unsure how the "unitSizeMult" stat works. i tried changing it to 2, but my troops didn't form into units twice as large as normal troops did. i got about 1.83X the number of troops in each platoon. what could i do to get 2X the size in troop size? (marines formed squads of 40, my new troops formed squads of 62.)
        2) is there a way to 'hide' the option of creating a certain troop type (on the invasion screen), until i tell the game to let the player use it? I dont want to clutter the UI to mush with random things i want to add.
        3) is there a way to deside what is hidden and not in the 'resources on fleet' part of a invasion? I find that it shows some things i want very hidden for a surprise (things that are in the crew replacer job for nex_groundBattle_marines, i mean.), and does not show anything related to new unitTypes.
        4) is there a way to change the way a unitType looks based off code on a per platoon basis? i want to change what image a unit appears as depending on what crew replacer ends up putting in it.
    reports:
        1) in the screen before the invasion begins, were it displays your forces it does not take into acount any new troop types you may have on bord.
        2) when trying to make a unit type with both 'equipment' and 'personnel' i find that the number of each used is not reflective of there relevant 'mult' stat. in testing with equipment mult: 10 and personnel multi: 1, i got 31 personnel to 400 equipment in a platoon.

    please understand that i have only been testing this for a few hours now, and have just started to unravel how all this works. some of my questions and reports might just be user error that i will uncover in the upcoming days, so sorry if i said something silly.
    PS: this is really really cool system you added. i have all sorts of interesting plans its going to be flavorful =)
im going to work on the following now:
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(started)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -(done)gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -(not done)change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
         -add images to the t2 personal robot manufactures

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.
robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.

    report:
        Unsure if this is already known or not:
        Using that construction mod that allows for space station construction,etc. Made a station and tried to change the pop there to your ai.
        The building was made. Only problem was that the colony growth thing that showed % only showed "NaN".
        Waited for a few ingame months but it was still the same and there was no growth on said stations.
missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
