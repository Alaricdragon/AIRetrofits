to do list before next update:
    test and try to find the possible issues with the 'change market condition code' in 'AI-Pop' condition
        -note: when useing sateration bombardment, i need to wait a few days after market transfer to check if that works or not.
    test the possibility of using combat robots for nexerline invasions

    (?)create a hullmod for the fighters.
    (HERE: doing this right now. see constants text file.)create a class that holds all static data so its easyer to change.
    update the robot numbers created to be the same amount, -20%, based on robot power produced.
    make it so 'upgrading' a S-Mod with the automated ship installation center, give bonus XP based on story ponits gotten, like if i were to sell / scuttle the ship.

    fix the last few issues with growth:
        not removing freeport.
        possobility, that my blanket negitive will try to remove mods that i have already removed.

    (done)make it so i get the robot forge ability the moment i have a ship that has said ability.
    (done)make it so the 'give me hullmods' check on game load, and when i get a skill.
NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details

Note:
    regarding replaceing crew and marrines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.

Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            (never mind. that's now how it normally works.)color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
            when the industry is not functional, there needs to be text showing it will not work.
            when the industry is not on a player owned world, it should cost credits to retrofit ships.
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
            -Important: make it so it does not try to add the hullmod onto ships with no min crew requirements. in fact, bar them from entering the ship yard at all.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
    robotic replacement thing:
        done, for now. needs to be reworked at a latter date
    population factory's:
        add a bit of text to show how mush growth each factory is producing.
market:
    (done)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (moved this idea over to market retrofits?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.
    -move all strings into the config. right now the 'cant install' strings are not accsesable.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
