to do list:
Industrys:
    add descriptions to CSV file.
    finish balance.
    finish adding supply demand and effects to all buildings.
Shipyard:
    to do:
        (DONE)add the ability for ships from a market with a shipyard to get the shipyard's hullmod on them.
    issues:
        color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
        if i remove the building, the sub-market will vanish. this will destroy all ships in said submarket.
         -solution: add a way to move the ships from the shipyard submarket to the storage submarket.
         -ACTIVE TEMP solution:
            1) prevent shipyard code from running when the industry is not present
            2) prevent the upmarket from being removed when there are ships inside of it
questions:
    how to make an industry send resources to your supply point
    how to add text prosaically to an item
market:
    (done!)build the framework for all the new buildings.
    (done!) finish making the code to do the market growth calculation.
    (started)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (done!) create the market growth code for advanced robotic factory's.
    (started)balance pop growth factory's.
        -need to add an negative when an factory has an supply defect / exes.
        -need to put more work into th number of salvage drones an factory produces.
        -need to put a lot of configs in said market.
        ISSUE: i seem to be runing the T2 factory growth for bouth the T1 and T2 factory. this needs looking into
    (not possable?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Combatability:
    -(done. not tested)add code to make it so you get the robotforge hullmod/skill, and AIRetrofits hullmod when you have AIRetrofits and don't have said hullmods and ability.
Robot Forge:
    -(done.)improve descriptions.
    -(done. not tested)make it so you get the skill after finding the robot forge hullmod.
    -(started)add an option to build people from sub command nodes.

Robots:
    -add an extra part to there description that shows:
        -size
        -crew-power.
        -(this is done for weapons. it can be done here.)
    -change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -finish the repairs to the hullmod, fixing the last weirdness of its description
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.

AI Market plugin:
    Important: Note: the guy who made nex contacted me and we talked about the CSV file a little. he said the the lake of conditions in one of
                     my rules might be causing issues. reference the discord conversation for details
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the randomly not working nature of the plugin.
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact you cant click on the plugin at random times, and need to spam click it to get it to work
        -why?
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
