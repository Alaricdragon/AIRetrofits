THE GRAND DE-JANKIFICATION
this is the process of making my mod make some fucking sense. it will be divided into a few parts.
1) strings
    -(DONE. testing required)move all strings (both from the settings.json file, and hardcoded strings) into there own json file. this file will allow easyer editing of strings.
    -(done)make sure to edit all the strings. go into every possable folder and fix the shit that does not work.
    -change the way the names work to have there own set of names as a CSV file. (for ease of use)
    -(done)run through a list of chances:
    -open every possible text field in the game, make sure all the text makes sense and is not sloppy.
        hullmods:
            -(done)robot forge
                -calls robots 'robotic drones'
                -calls robot forge power 'crew power' (only once)
            -(done)AIRetrofits (base)
                -the 'additional opp oer x crew' text shows a number that is not one.
                    -this looks like a translation issue. i should change the 2 varubles that show 'how mush exstrea opp it costs' and 'how mush total opp it costs' to '1' and 'extra opp cost'
                -were it says how mush max crew is removed from the ship, it needs to be more clear that it removes max crew equal to the min crew of the ship.
                -make sure the max possible amount of max crew that can be removed is equal to the max crew of the ship. just in case.
            -(done)AIRetrofits (patchwork)
                -same as (base)
                -(done. fucking finaly)find a solution to the fact that changing an AI-Retrofits hullmod removed all combat readiness. for the love of god.
            -AIRetrofits (perma) (base)
                -'can be replaced by a simpler modification' -> 'can be replaced by a similar modification'
                -need to remove decimal ponit from stat changes.
                -were it says how mush max crew is removed from the ship, it needs to be more clear that it removes max crew equal to the min crew of the ship.
                -were it says what my modifcations were made from, is um, i dont even know. but i need to change it.
                    -eather to be the hullmods name, or to be the name of the building / submarket that creates the changes
                -make sure the max possible amount of max crew that can be removed is equal to the max crew of the ship. just in case.
            -AIRetrofits (perma) (Gamma)
                -same as (perma) (base)
            -AIRetrofits (perma) (Alpha)
                -same as (perma) (base)
                -for every x crew exstra crew quarters is budged.
                -the max opp added is bugged (i think?)
                -the amount of opp shown is bugged.
                -at no point does it say it reduced the amount of required crew to zero.
            -AIRetrofits (perma) (Omega)
                -same as (perma) (Alpha)
                -shows the wrong item that cuased modifcation (needs to be changed anyways so, no matter.)
        skills:
            -robot forge
                -in selection:
                    -names of options don't have capitals (I think i failed to add them to the settings.json)
                    -were it shows how many things i can forge a day, it has 2 many decemo points. (for all displayed commodity's)
                    -in 'imporve a sub command node':
                        -it says i carefully consider what i can produce AGAIN for some reason?
                        -options are not capitalized. should capitalize officer, admin, and operative.
                        -on create officer, continue is not capitalized.
                        -on create officer, i need to have a warning or presentation stopping me from creating officers past the players maximum.
                            -i would prefer a warning.
                        -on create admin, i need to have a warning or presentation stopping me from creating officers past the players maximum.
                            -i would prefer i warning.
                in hotbar
                    -the description were it shows how mush power is available is not caped to one demo point.
                        -i think there is something for this in Misc.
                    -when active:
                        -were it shows what im forging, the spacing is way wayyy off.
                        -were it shows what im forging, there are random ',' just after the first work (should not be there)
                        -were it shows what im forging, there is no ',' between forged requirements.

questions:
    1) i am currently adding hullmods in a hullmods __ function useing __. is there a way to make this process not consume op?
    2) i am currently getting a hullmod to remove itself in its __ function useing __. is there a way to make this process not consume op?


2) for robots crewReplacer_jobs:
    1) make it so robots are withen the 'crewSet' system. for real, how da fuck did i forget this!!?!!
3) colonly
    -for main colonly demands:
        1) make it so the colonly loses stability at any level.
        2) make it so the colony losses extra stability as it losses items (like how food normaly behaves)
        3) make it so other industrys loss supply based on the missing demand (with the changed demand beign caused by the supply demand libary)
        4) rebalanced the amount of demand population and infrastructure requires. in addition to this, rebalanced the amount of supply it produces (for things like robotic replacement parts
        5) create a building that, at the cost of demanding a lot of things, as well as a quite high upkeep, nullifies the 'missing demand' penalitys
            other options for this include:
                -making it so you can only have one
                -making it into a industry, that produces no income(so the player wants to get rid of it faster)
            note: i want it to demand a bunch of stuff to meet its functional requirements, and if it starts to miss demand, it slowly stops nullifing the penalitys.
    -for the shipyard:
        1) make it so the shipyard scales with colonly size (its so slow without its smod bonus, but to fast with it.
        2) make it so the shipyard costs a certen amount of 'time' to convert a ship ('MinCrew' + shipsize). let this value keep in mind modified values (excluding other AI-Retrofits)?
        3) make it so the shipyard can convert ships not at the end of the month (just gives a report then), but only update that information when the player looks at it.
        4) make it so the shipyard losses production as demand is unmet
    -for growth:
        change the way growth works to the following:
            1) make the commodity used for growth into 'robot frames'
            2) make it so markets demand robot frames (up to the max number produced that is available to them). the market can then loss growth based on the number of missing demand for robot frames.
            3) make it so the markets accessibility is marked when calculating how many robot frames / growth the market gets.
            4) make it so high hazard worlds receive a growth negative (to represent robots being destroyed by damage)
    -descriptions:
        1) make it so the most advanced AI-Cores have descriptions in the relevant industry's
    -population and industry:
        there is a way for people to add there own 'modifyers' of the main population building without overriding it.
        I have no clue how this works. i need to find out and do it.
4) update items????
    most items do nothing. i want to change that. i had this idea for a while, but now its finaly time.
    (this feels wried)
    1) make it so 'robotic replacement parts' reduce the casualty of robots after operations by ?%. (at the cost to themselves)
    2) make it so 'robotic matnace packs' increase the total power of your robots by up to ?% (at equal numbers packs to robots)? (or maybe 1/5 packs to robots)?, but use them at a rate of 1/20 per operation????
        -i dont like this.
        -if they should do anything, they should be used as acusal matnace for more advaned robot types maybe? that could at least not suck...
    3) maybe edit the way the 'robotic interface thingy mabob' works. so its no longer like, a flush golem, but instead more like a... like a robot you talk to?? i dont know...
5) edit the robot forge
    -this reuqires acsess to the one, the only, forge production. but i want to move my robot forge over to that, for all sorts of reasons. this will also help with some issues in the display, as well as haveing 1 > x > 0 items. becuase it forges by days.
6) reactivate and rebuild the 'what is defending' libary
    -this is something that has been on my nerves for a while now. and i dont fucking like it. i love this system, and i wanna use it dam you!
    so, im going to make a library, then ask the nexerlin person if they want it.
    -FOR NOW, i could just set a 'mark' of when each world was last updated for its defence modifier. when its attacked or visited, i could update that world again, or after a set amount of time?
7) misc bugs:
    1) AI-Retrofits can reduce max crew by more then it reduces min crew? unknown how it does that.
    2) AI-Retrofits mod causes signifacantly increased load times when adding / removing flux caps/vents. need to investagate
    3) add a option to make it so the player starts with the 'patchwork ai retrofits' hullmod.
    4) add a system to add hullmods on game load, instead of interacting with things.
8) luna-lib support. for in game settings.

Ground battle unit defs are now moddable, can add new ones or modify existing ones in data/config/exerelin/groundBattleDefs.json
Player can create units with modded unit types if the unit def allows it
NPCs will use default ground units, use a GroundBattleListener to add or replace units as necessary
    in GroundBattleListiner: InvasionIntel.from to ge the market in from.
    in groundBattleDefs.json, you gotta scrol down a little to get to the part about troop types.
questions:
    (for nexerlins developer):
plans for the invasions:
    status:
        I have a in built system that looks at and determins the number of each type of bots one should have for each job.
        I need to hock this up into the spot were changes can accor.
    i require a class that can swap out base combat units the AI uses based on conditions and ratios.
    this class will need to beable to:
    1)(done) have a condition to actavate swaping.
    2)(done) have a function that determines the ratio of unswaped units that will be swapped.
    3)(no longer doing) beable to alture the number of platoons created by this method, (to match what the actual combat strength should have been from the attackers
    3.b)(done)so, because i have 'stronger' combat robots, this therefore means i have a higher damage density, makeing things like for example, the defence value of a world, not be true.
        the sollution is simple ish:
            1) give every world a modifier to its defence stat, based on the % of robots that are upgraded on said world (example, i have a 30% chance of advanced robots, add a defnce multi of(0.3*1.5625 )) AKA (cahnce * powerDensity). this will allow for more acreate damage numbers.
                note: also note, there are more then one type of robots, so the calculation should be something like... OR = (cahnce * powerDensity), AR = (math.max(1-OR,change) * pwoerDensity). then have 2 mods one for OR, and one for AR.
            2) make it so every time i add a new 'advanced' robot, a certen number of not advanced robots on the battle field. (example: I replace 2 marrines (2 DD) for 2 advanced robots (3.125 DD) I have 1.125 exstra DD, so next time my code checks to remove a marrine, remove it instead.
            this is good, because it lets my new robots : buff the worlds/faction, display correct 'defence' number, and be power houses that you should be afraid of.
            (NOTE: this will need to be done in the ground battle listener)
    ISSUES:
    on gorund defences:
        2) rebels on worlds are set to the attacking faction. i want this to not be the case. so i will need a specal class to habdle that.
            -i talked to the develuper of nexerlin about this issue. they say its fixed next update.
    on AI generated units:
        1) unit number: the size of a given squad does not seem to respect the 'multi' of the squad in size.
           this might be a bug, but this also might be a issue with nexerlin. i will report this just in case
        2) everytime i attempt to make a ground unit, for a single moment, and only one, marrines are included in omega robots equation.
            what the fuck is even going on?!?!?!?!!!!?!? how why??!? i dont get it... i will need mroe data
            -in farther testing:
                T1 robot not effected.
                T0 robot sometimes still has marine in it even after...??????
                T2 robot always effected???????
    on creating player units:
        issues:
            incorrect unit sizes. the reason is believed to be a issue with the unit multi.
            heavy units might not have the right power, as i might have guessed the eq for that wrong.
            -power and deploy cost are dependent on the number of heavy units for heavy units. the number of personnel is not relevant.
        3 possibility:
            a_2) use the normal buttons. whenever i group is spawned, if it contains robots, reset the personnel and equipment map, then spawn a unit of that squad from the players inventory.
                -if i go with this, i will need to do the following:
                    1) set each unit to have a power in nexerline_mareins and nexerline_tankcrew.
                    2) create a system that goes though the personell map, and checks to see if any personell match a robot type.
                    3) if a robot type is found:
                        3.1) change the unit definition to the robots definition.
                        3.2) return both the personell and equitmet maps to cargo.
                        3.3) calculate the size of squad i can create with this methood.
                        3.4) unit.setSize.
                   -NOTE: if i do this, i will need to remove the options for each robot's powers (for a robot group, and for marine group) from the config, because they will no longer matter.
                -issue:
                    1)  reportUnitCreated(GroundUnit b) does not do anything for player units.
                        this is frusterating. like omg its so nm sakdknasdkjsajkdsakjdkjaskdjsakjksa
                        i will ask the nexerlin person about this later
            a) use the normal buttons. whenever spawned, get the unit that is most prominent (be it the highest level, or largest number of units) in said group and set the unit def to reflect this, copying over the personnel map for said group.
                -if i go with this i will need to preform the following process for each unit:
                    -both:
                        1) give each unit a power equal to its units power.
                        2) when i create a unit with a mix of units, if its only robots, set it to the basic combat robot definition?
                        3) if its one type of robot, change the units definition to that type, and then attempt to adjust the size of the squad to the right number for that unit squad. (some squads are more dense then others.)
                            -if its a heavy unit, make sure to adjust its 'heavy units' as well, using the crew replacer job, if available.
                            -NOTE: doing this might require that i -reduce- the number of heavy units, and because its a job, im likely going to just have to remove and recreate the squad, making sure to return items to the players cargo bay.

                -issue:
                    1) heavy and none heavy ratios: they are diffrent. options:
                        a) make 4 sets of values: one for with marrine units, one for basic heavy units, one for only robot units. one for only robot heavy units.
                            -issues: would result in wired results with basic heavy units, and i cant seperate them at all =(
                            -issues: the heavy unit results are... nonsensical. i would need to do something crazy to make this work....
                                -why? the number of robots per heavy weapons would be very different between a basic squad, a robot squad, and the squad they are designed around....
                            -the best i can see this working is simple: simple splice off the OCR and ACR from the basic groups (as there ratio makes no sense). effectively refuse to let them deploy. if a unit is detected with said robots in it,
                            remove that unit and attempt to make a robotic unit instead.
                            -NOTE: for the same reasons, this will prevent group mixing. effectively, i can only have groups with one type of robot at a time.
                            -NOTE: group mixing works for BCR and marrines, because they have the same unit per HW raitio...
                            -note: there is a second option: simply make the ratio of weapons per (robot*robotPower) the same on each...
                            for example: OCR = 5. base H/M raitio is 1/2. so therefor a unit would have 10/2 of H/OCR. this would let the robot have 5 power in a HCU and 10 power in a RCU...
                -to do right now (as im trying to get this working)
                    1) set the values for every type of robot, for every one of its possible 4 jobs, in the settings file (already linked in code to the relevant jobs.).
                    2) test
            b) the same as a, but use my own 'create robot' buttons.
                -issues:
                    1) the possibility of losing data when i change the robot type.
            c) have a button for each robot type. avoid the issue of changing robot types entirely.
                -issues:
                    1)this is a mess to interact with. i can help reduce the mess by 'hiding' buttons when they are not available, but that... does not really help me that mush. because the moment you have 2 types of robots, BAM messy as flip.

im going to work on the following now:
    random required changes:
    1) update invasions
        -status:
            defender works.
            attacker works
            detailes:
                1.0) new unit types and icons:
                    -modify definitions.
                    -modify the 'PTSR' for all units.
                    -modify the 'Raito' for all units.
                    -modify the AIRetrofit_MaxGroundDefenceBonusFromT2Bots to match the PTSR
                    -create images for heavy robots, provided i want them.
                1.1)(started)updated combat robot image:
                1.2)(DONE)ratio of bot types depending on conditions:
                1.3)(DONE)increase defence when higher teir robots are in play:
                1.4)(DONE)remove defenders based on the 'power-size ratio' of newly added defenders:
                    -ths idea of this, is to increase the number of defence value i have based on how many (T1,T2) robots will be present. so the 'defences' on a colonly will always match said colonlys defencive value
                1.5)(NOT REQUIRED)remove attackers based on the 'size ratio' for newly added attackers
                    -do to reasons (mainly how i plan to set up the unit definitions), this is always 1. so this never factors in.
                1.6) add description to alpha level core for what it does to ground forces. (saying something like 'some units are replaced' or something.)
                    -maybe even something more detailed, like saying how mush supply and demand there is on the player markets, and how mush local and none local supply this forge is adding.
                1.7) PASSABLE ISSUES:
                    1.7.a) (fixed) tested out some things related to combat robots. supply and demand of marines might not be taken into effect? testing required.
                    1.7.b) (fixed) ground units are vanishing. pasificly the ones i get from changing heavy unitd. i think it has something to do with an invalid unit map. see groundUnit Attacker for logs.
                    1.7.c) (fixed) omega core bonus will not vanish when multiple worlds are present.
                1.8)(done) set the relevent values to the config.
                    -note: damage density diffrences:
                        T1 Cr = 1.5625
                        T1 Wr = 1.5625
                        T2 Cr = 5
                        T2 Wr = 6
                        T1 Cr / mal = 2.5 (NOTE: this might cause issues, having this value so high, so i might reduce this to 2)
                1.9)(done) set the relevent values in the ground combat json.
    2) change automated shipyard to be by crew basis, and slowly increase its production the longer something is inside of it.
    3) change images of robots (see 'update the robots') and other items
        -robot forge needs new image.
            -new combat robot needs to follow the ideology of 'low tech' robots.
                -need some new parts:
                    -recolored base.
                    -new legs of some type. (the current ones suck like really suck i hate them >=( )
        -combat robot needs new image.
        -all robot images need to have there scales and positions (in picture) standardized.
    4) update spelling and grammar from all my texts. apparently, the default way to handles capitals in the game is to only have the first letter of a name (even if the name has multiple words) to be capitalized.
        NOTE: something useful here, is to copy the system from crew replacer over to this mod, so i might have more string control.
        -also, there was a issue with the 'population and infrastructure' displaying the word 'name' after its world name. will need to look into that.
        -also, combat robots alpha core description might be bugged.
        -also, i want to put all the strings into thtere own part of the config.
    5) update the automated shipyard to work on a by crew basis. please.
    6) check all my items and make sure the distance between them is what i want it to be (example of something that needs to improve: advanced combat robot,Omega combat robot)
    7) add descriptions to what the omega core does on each industry (new game version has a function for that now. so thats cool)
    8) make sure the fleet inflater for AI-Retrofits is not applying its hullmod to ships with no crew requirements
    9) review, and attempt to fix the issue related to stations growth being equal to null. the reason for this is unkown, but reseting the population when its null might work maybe?
        -note: population composition might need to be reinitialized.
        -note: terraforming and station construction might be causing issues.
    10) add a custom 'market card' to nexerlin, that lets you change your market to a AI-Pop market at the start of the game.
    11) deal with all the misc logs that are everywere that i dont need. keep error logs.
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(started)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -(done)gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -(not done)change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
         -add images to the t2 personal robot manufactures
    updated robot forge.
    change to interface to have 2 parts:
        forgeing
        improve command node.
        keep 'imporve command node' the same.
        in 'forgeing' put all my crafting resapies, and allow for the following:
        1) a 'scroll bar' (like what nexerlin 'request a fleet' interface has for fleet strangth). this will allow you to determin 2 things:
            1) the 'wight' of production for a given robot.
            2) how many robots you desire to be made.
        2) let the forge overview show the following:
            1) how mush resources you are projected to use (as well as how many items you are projected to gain)
            2) the projected time to complete each robot type.
            3) the max number of robots you can build with your resources.
            4) how mush cargo you are projected to have at the end of the robot forgeing process.

bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.
    issue: nomadic survival crewSet for my robots does not have its own item in the config. just uses a random robot instead. will need to fix this.
    report:
        Unsure if this is already known or not:
        Using that construction mod that allows for space station construction,etc. Made a station and tried to change the pop there to your ai.
        The building was made. Only problem was that the colony growth thing that showed % only showed "NaN".
        Waited for a few ingame months but it was still the same and there was no growth on said stations.
missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
