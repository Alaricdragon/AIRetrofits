to do list before next update:
    test and try to find the possible issues with the 'change market condition code' in 'AI-Pop' condition
        -note: when useing sateration bombardment, i need to wait a few days after market transfer to check if that works or not.
    (?)create a hullmod for the fighters.
    make it so 'upgrading' a S-Mod with the automated ship installation center, give bonus XP based on story ponits gotten, like if i were to sell / scuttle the ship.

NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.

diolog:
    missing in the options:
        the robot forge people maker has no links to the options, i need to add some.
    needs some upgrades to the text:
        the robot forge people maker has some... questionable text. to put it simply, its all placeholder. it was quite something to find at random. need to improve it.
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            when the industry is not on a player owned world, it should cost credits to retrofit ships.
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:
            so very closs to finished. need to:
            polish text
            add bonus XP gain.
                -issues with this: i have so far failed completely to do this. its so frustrating. i cant get the bonus XP i should get from one S-mod...
            add text for bonus XP gain (like 'gained xx XP from removed S-Mods')
            move all text to the config file, for ease of change.
market:
    (moved this idea over to market retrofits?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
