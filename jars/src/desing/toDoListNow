Ground battle unit defs are now moddable, can add new ones or modify existing ones in data/config/exerelin/groundBattleDefs.json
Player can create units with modded unit types if the unit def allows it
NPCs will use default ground units, use a GroundBattleListener to add or replace units as necessary
    in GroundBattleListiner: InvasionIntel.from to ge the market in from.
    in groundBattleDefs.json, you gotta scrol down a little to get to the part about troop types.
questions:
    (for nexerlins developer):
hey, thanks for agreeing to look at the possibility of adding a crewSet system to your nexerlin. i know im asking for a bunch of things right now, but thank you for being not mad at that. hopefully.
ok, so i now have more reports, and responses:
1) so i found some new issues: the version you sent me does not seem to take into account crew replacer added commodity when it should relevant ground strength at the start of a battle. (different from it not displaying ground strength from new unit creatable unit types, probably.)
2) ok, in this regard to response 7), i did some testing, and with the following code, i was able to create issues. it seems that your code is not taking into account a crew crewReplacer.getCrewPower(), at least for how mush damage each commodity was using. It was however for how mush space each commodity should be using. that's why the stats i was seeing were so odd.
[code] crewReplacer_Crew temp = new crewReplacer_Crew(){
    @Override
     public float getCrewPower(CargoAPI cargo) {
         return 5;
     }
};
temp.crewPower = 1f;
temp.name = "ore";
crewReplacer_Main.getJob("nex_groundBattle_marines").addCrew(temp);
[/code]
3) you asked for something to try and replecate bugs with, so i desided to minamize a thing, so you could get the 'you cant build units any more' bug. as its the only one i dont understand yet.
I used crew replacer for this, btw.
so yay, just approach a market with only heavy arms, create a platoon, deploy it onto the surface, then watch as the 'marine' button lets you click it and breaks things. simple ish hopefully
[code]
	"unitTypes":{
		#basic combat robots,
		#2X size, 0.5X strangth, 2X moral, 0.5X cost
		"breakYourGame":{
			"name":"bugy bug",

			#"sprite":"graphics/icons/grounBattles/AIRetrofit_Advanced_Combat Robot.png",	# used in background of unit card; not automatically loaded so specify it in settings.json if needed
			"playerCanCreate":true,

		}
	},

plans for the invasions:
    status:
        I have a in built system that looks at and determins the number of each type of bots one should have for each job.
        I need to hock this up into the spot were changes can accor.
    i require a class that can swap out base combat units the AI uses based on conditions and ratios.
    this class will need to beable to:
    1)(done) have a condition to actavate swaping.
    2)(done) have a function that determines the ratio of unswaped units that will be swapped.
    3)(NOT done.) beable to alture the number of platoons created by this method, (to match what the actual combat strength should have been from the attackers)

    --) there is a issue however. that is that i want players to beable to create there own units as well, without to mush hassle.
        -how would one do this? simple:
        a) find a way to keep trake of the number and type of units in a squad and transfer them over to a new squad type on squad createdion.
            -note: the units in a crew is likely stored somewere in GroundUnit.data. this is a issue, because i will need to get all items from this. maybe there is a way now that i think of it........
                   i have ran a few tests and found that yes. yes i can do the thing in relation to this. its not even that hard to do, you know.
                   so ya. it returns the data in the form of something that i might beable to use. i am unsure. but how usefull will it be? unknown.
                   so, things i can do for this:
                   provied a platoon only contains robots, i can change the platoon to a robotic force, provided all the inputed items are already in the crew replacer for said robotic force.
        b) find a way to simply swap the picture and stats of each platoon indavidgualy. as to avoid any unesseary issues


    on creating player units:
        3 possibility:
            a) use the normal buttons. whenever spawned, get the unit that is most prominent (be it the highest level, or largest number of units) in said group and set the unit def to reflect this, copying over the personnel map for said group.
                -issues:
                    1) the possibility of losing data when i change the robot type.
                    2) my crewReplacerJob for my robots will need to use the normal nex jobs for this. but this has the possible issue of forcefully changing my icon to something i dont want.
            b) the same as a, but use my own 'create robot' buttons.
                -issues:
                    1) the possibility of losing data when i change the robot type.
            c) have a button for each robot type. avoid the issue of changing robot types entirely.
                -issues:
                    1)this is a mess to interact with. i can help reduce the mess by 'hiding' buttons when they are not available, but that... does not really help me that mush. because the moment you have 2 types of robots, BAM messy as flip.


im going to work on the following now:
    random required changes:
    1) change automated shipyard to be by crew basis, and slowly increase its production the longer something is inside of it.
    2) change images of robots (see 'update the robots')
    3) update spelling and grammer from all my texts. aparently, the defalt way to handles capitals in the game is to only have the first letter of a name (even if the name has multiple words) to be capitalized.
        -also, there was a issue with the 'population and infrastructure' displaying the word 'name' after its world name. will need to look into that.
    4) update the automated shipyard to work on a by crew basis. please.
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(started)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -(done)gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -(not done)change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
         -add images to the t2 personal robot manufactures

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.
robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.

    report:
        Unsure if this is already known or not:
        Using that construction mod that allows for space station construction,etc. Made a station and tried to change the pop there to your ai.
        The building was made. Only problem was that the colony growth thing that showed % only showed "NaN".
        Waited for a few ingame months but it was still the same and there was no growth on said stations.
missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
