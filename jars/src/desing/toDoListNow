to do list:
on next non save compatible update:
    move the industry into relevant folders for ease of accuses
NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details
images:
    options:
        1) get someone to do it for me.
            known options are:
            Sophie. : friend. might be willing to help
            https://www.artstation.com/antonjuntunen : the one who drew things for industrial evolution.
            AI generated images: this might be hard, but they do draw hell of a good images,

        2) do it myself.
            i like doing things myself, for myself. its just -better- in my opining.
            but my art... i could do it by hand, but in the style required? not a chance.
            maybe i could, but i would have to start at the beginning.
            i would need to start not with the computer, but with a pencil and paper.
            mmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMjbghvhnm
            do i want this done myself? in part yet. the idea of making art for this project gets me quite happy. i want to do it.
            but im no good? what the hell has that ever stopped me? not now, not ever! i will rain supreme!
            there is a lot of it to do however

    start to work on images. and what they are.
    i want to open with the salvage, survey, and combat robots, then item, then industrys.
    this is -required- to be finished.
    also me want images.
    please me. rework the way salvage and survey bots look.
    combat bots can get a rework latter.
    created images file for ideas.
Industrys:
    all:
        AICore modifiers do not display that they have a AI core installed right. this will be fixed.
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
            when the industry is not functional, there needs to be text showing it will not work.
            when the industry is not on a player owned world, it should cost credits to retrofit ships.
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.

    robotic replacement thing:
        work and design something as a temporarily thing.
    Manufactures of all type
        -done?
    salvage robot manufactury:
        make its gamma core modifier do something on worlds with non AI population, because its wired to have it as it is now.

market:
    (done)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (moved this idea over to market retrofits?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Robots:
    -change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
