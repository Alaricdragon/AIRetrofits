Ground battle unit defs are now moddable, can add new ones or modify existing ones in data/config/exerelin/groundBattleDefs.json
Player can create units with modded unit types if the unit def allows it
NPCs will use default ground units, use a GroundBattleListener to add or replace units as necessary
    in GroundBattleListiner: InvasionIntel.from to ge the market in from.
    in groundBattleDefs.json, you gotta scrol down a little to get to the part about troop types.
questions:
    (for nexerlins developer):
    hello again.
plans for the invasions:
    status:
        I have a in built system that looks at and determins the number of each type of bots one should have for each job.
        I need to hock this up into the spot were changes can accor.
    i require a class that can swap out base combat units the AI uses based on conditions and ratios.
    this class will need to beable to:
    1)(done) have a condition to actavate swaping.
    2)(done) have a function that determines the ratio of unswaped units that will be swapped.
    3)(no longer doing) beable to alture the number of platoons created by this method, (to match what the actual combat strength should have been from the attackers
    3.b)so, because i have 'stronger' combat robots, this therefore means i have a higher damage density, makeing things like for example, the defence value of a world, not be true.
        the sollution is simple ish:
            1) give every world a modifier to its defence stat, based on the % of robots that are upgraded on said world (example, i have a 30% chance of advanced robots, add a defnce multi of(0.3*1.5625 )) AKA (cahnce * powerDensity). this will allow for more acreate damage numbers.
                note: also note, there are more then one type of robots, so the calculation should be something like... OR = (cahnce * powerDensity), AR = (math.max(1-OR,change) * pwoerDensity). then have 2 mods one for OR, and one for AR.
            2) make it so every time i add a new 'advanced' robot, a certen number of not advanced robots on the battle field. (example: I replace 2 marrines (2 DD) for 2 advanced robots (3.125 DD) I have 1.125 exstra DD, so next time my code checks to remove a marrine, remove it instead.
            this is good, because it lets my new robots : buff the worlds/faction, display correct 'defence' number, and be power houses that you should be afraid of.
            (NOTE: this will need to be done in the ground battle listener)

    --) there is a issue however. that is that i want players to beable to create there own units as well, without to mush hassle.
        -how would one do this? simple:
        a) find a way to keep trake of the number and type of units in a squad and transfer them over to a new squad type on squad createdion.
            -note: the units in a crew is likely stored somewere in GroundUnit.data. this is a issue, because i will need to get all items from this. maybe there is a way now that i think of it........
                   i have ran a few tests and found that yes. yes i can do the thing in relation to this. its not even that hard to do, you know.
                   so ya. it returns the data in the form of something that i might beable to use. i am unsure. but how usefull will it be? unknown.
                   so, things i can do for this:
                   provied a platoon only contains robots, i can change the platoon to a robotic force, provided all the inputed items are already in the crew replacer for said robotic force.
        b) find a way to simply swap the picture and stats of each platoon indavidgualy. as to avoid any unesseary issues

    ISSUES:
        1)right now, attacker units from alpha-T2 manufactuory are never being changed. need to do more logs...
            -theory: all units 'market i came from' memory is equal to the attacking world.
            -theory: YHW-FOMSLKFJKSDNJKDSAJDJNAJASD
    on creating player units:
        3 possibility:
            a) use the normal buttons. whenever spawned, get the unit that is most prominent (be it the highest level, or largest number of units) in said group and set the unit def to reflect this, copying over the personnel map for said group.
                -issues:
                    1) the possibility of losing data when i change the robot type.
                    2) my crewReplacerJob for my robots will need to use the normal nex jobs for this. but this has the possible issue of forcefully changing my icon to something i dont want.
            b) the same as a, but use my own 'create robot' buttons.
                -issues:
                    1) the possibility of losing data when i change the robot type.
            c) have a button for each robot type. avoid the issue of changing robot types entirely.
                -issues:
                    1)this is a mess to interact with. i can help reduce the mess by 'hiding' buttons when they are not available, but that... does not really help me that mush. because the moment you have 2 types of robots, BAM messy as flip.


im going to work on the following now:
    random required changes:
    1) change automated shipyard to be by crew basis, and slowly increase its production the longer something is inside of it.
    2) change images of robots (see 'update the robots')
    3) update spelling and grammar from all my texts. apparently, the default way to handles capitals in the game is to only have the first letter of a name (even if the name has multiple words) to be capitalized.
        NOTE: something useful here, is to copy the system from crew replacer over to this mod, so i might have more string control.
        -also, there was a issue with the 'population and infrastructure' displaying the word 'name' after its world name. will need to look into that.
        -also, combat robots alpha core description might be bugged.
        -also, i want to put all the strings into thtere own part of the config.
    4) update the automated shipyard to work on a by crew basis. please.
    5) check all my items and make sure the distance between them is what i want it to be (example of something that needs to improve: advanced combat robot)
    6) add descriptions to what the omega core does on each industry (new game version has a function for that now. so thats cool)
    7) make sure the fleet inflater for AI-Retrofits is not applying its hullmod to ships with no crew requirements
    8) review, and attempt to fix the issue related to stations growth being equal to null. the reason for this is unkown, but reseting the population when its null might work maybe?
    9) add a custom 'market card' to nexerlin, that lets you change your market to a AI-Pop market at the start of the game.
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(started)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -(done)gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -(not done)change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
         -add images to the t2 personal robot manufactures

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.
robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.

    report:
        Unsure if this is already known or not:
        Using that construction mod that allows for space station construction,etc. Made a station and tried to change the pop there to your ai.
        The building was made. Only problem was that the colony growth thing that showed % only showed "NaN".
        Waited for a few ingame months but it was still the same and there was no growth on said stations.
missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
