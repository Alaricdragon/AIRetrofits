to do list before next update:
    test and try to find the possible issues with the 'change market condition code' in 'AI-Pop' condition
        -note: using saturation bombardment is out until the creator of nexerlin tells me if that's a issue with my or his mods.
    test the possibility of using combat robots for nexerline invasions
    growth:
        find out what setting is 'max market size' so i add it to the 'max size before i stop getting population'. setting.

NOTE:
    just tried a thing with growth. it works.
    view growth -AI-Pop for details

Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            color of 'points available' needs to change to improved color when i have the industry improved.
            when the industry is not functional, there needs to be text showing it will not work.
            when the industry is not on a player owned world, it should cost credits to retrofit ships.
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
    robotic replacement thing:
        work and design something as a temporarily thing.
    Manufactures of all type
        -done?
market:
    (done)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (moved this idea over to market retrofits?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
    -make this hullmod incompatible with all AIRetrofit_Shipyard hullmods.

AI Market plugin:
    new plan: in market retrofits, build a system for founding markets. with or without certain data.
              make it so the AI Market plugin must be ran through that instead.
              make the market retrofits plugin replace the old old one.
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
