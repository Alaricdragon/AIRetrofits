questions:
    1) how do i run ShipVariantAPI.removeMod() and ShipVariantAPI.addMod() without having said ship lose combat readyness?
    2)
im going to work on the following now:
    finalize the upgrades person robot forges
        -a industry level forge. with more output. yay output. (also fixes the issue with not enouth survey robots, without making a mess of things.)
    update the robots:
        new images when i have more robots (see crewReplacer showdo crew remover.)
        new survey drone mechanics. survey drones can now be consumed on worlds. are stronger, smaller, cheeper and build faster.
        increase the defence on all Omega robots. they need a buff that's not just silly, and greatly reduced losses are something that might just work.
    the new hull mods
        going to add the new hullmods i came up with. the crazy one can wait though
        -current status:
            -(started)robot storege thing:
                -(done)hullmod code
                -(not started)getting robots to have reduced cargo based on hullmods
                -(not started)displaying how many robots are in the robot storge
                - display and description and everything else
            -(started)patchwork AIRetrofits:
                -(done)gave it its extra stats (lower CR, chance of malfunctions)
                -(not done)change the image of the hullmod to something more brown or broken looking.
                -make it so swapping the patchwork AIRetrofit hullmod does not reduce combat readiness.
    the upgrades to the industry to make them all at least somewhat useful
        Command Node and relevant industry:
            nexerlin mod combatability:
                i want to have a way to have Command Nodes be operatives from nexerlin. to do this will require some background work:
                    issues:
                        (done)ithe new core type needs to create itself on a market. it might be choseing the wrong market in some situations.
                            -unknown reasons.
                        the f1 exstend description needs to show the relevent tasks a given operative can do.
                        (done)require rebalance: the thressholds per core cost.
                            -right now they are liner. might need to make them not so, as even a not to costly core can cost a lot of credits, for no reason.

            (started)Submarket:
                (done)add to csv
                add image
                add text.
                (done)make the market refuse to bye things.
                (done)make the market only sell command nodes.
                (done)allow the market to have diffrent strangths on command nodes.
                (done)allow AICores to change the submarkets AICore stats
                (done)make it so the submarket is added and removed with the industry
                (done)change description of the industry to say it adds this sub market.
                (done)change what the AI cores do on said industry.
                (done)make it so the sub market A does not exist, or B does not refresh well in industry is offline
                update the old exstra text in this submarket ()
                (done)make it so the number of core and total power is based on the amount of sub command node supply, and not something else.
                (done)make it so improving the industry does something. right now nothing happens.
                make it so when i move a item out of the submarket, i can put it back in
                (done)re ballance the sub markets AI-Cores. i calculate that they are never going to reach max level. power per core should -increase- as output does.
                    -to fix this, i should make the quality improve with a slight increase per production? maybe a increase of 5 percent power per production, so at production 3, its 15% increase, and production 10, its a 50% increase?
                    -options: (S = supply, P = powerPerSize, I = increasePerSize)
                        (not)a) POWER = (P*S)*(I*S).
                            (S=5,P=1,I=1.05) = 5*1.25 = 6.25
                            (S=5,P=1,I=1.1)  = 5*1.5 = 7.5
                        (yes)b) POWER = (P*S)*(I^S).
                            (S=5,P=1,I=1.05) = 5*1.2762815625 = 6.3814078125
                            (S=5,P=1,I=1.1)  = 5*1.61051 = 8.05255
            AICore Changes:
                (done)make it so the price of a given core is visable.
                (done)make it so the nexerlin operative command node shows the jobs it can do when you press F1 on it.
                make it so the AIRetrofit_CommandNodeType_Base class has a implementation that adds a given command node type to the robot forge.
            (started) person robot manufactorys:
                -(done)change amount of bots prouced to be based on the supply of the market.
                -(done)add a upgraded version of each manufactroy that scailes with market size.
                -(done)make the beta core bonus scale with supply, at the cost of reduceing per supply robo production of the manufacture, and with a smaler base bonus.
                -add images to the t2 personal robot manufactures

Note:
    regarding replacing crew and marines with salvage robots and combat robots:
        invasions work even with alpha shipyard modifier.
        i have no idea if this works or not. i don't think it does.
        tried an invasion fleet. none of my marines were combat robots like they should have been.
        although, it is known that currently in nexerlin, its not possible to tell if marines are marines after they have landed.
robot forge plugin:
    find a new sound for the robot forge
bugs:
    issue with: issue with market growth having a tiny modifier that's being added to all my AI worlds. no idea why. //(likely false)decimalize sub population given market growth when it should not be
    issue: (partly done. no longer changes contacts) right now i can change the name and portrait of important NPC's. make it so i cant.
    issue: advanced and omega robots have the same price as basic robots. change this plz.
    issue: the cost of a single survey / salvage / combat robot is the same regardless of level. i fixed this by changeing there demand class, but i want them to have the same demand classes so they can be interchangeable. look this up plz.
    issue: patchwork AIRetrofits being removed when it should not be. being swaped with AIRetrofits when it should not be. frusterating.
missing text:
    population and infastucture:
        need to move the "number of robots" text into setting sometime
Industrys:
    Shipyard:
        issues:
            change ship power over to something a crew based system, instead of a shipsized based system.
        concepts: allow players to build this industry on normal markets
            might be a good idea. make it change the fleets as well? i don't know.
            will reduce the need / want to build robotic markets, but maybe that's a good thing?
        notification:

        desing the concept for: having all the basic resource industry do something cool.
        why? because i never build them. even with up to + 8 stability, its just not worth it.
        so here what i have now:
            -moved this information into market - industry.
Robots:
    -?change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
    -if i do this, i could have the power boost decrease as more robots are added. say given 100% bost at 200 of a given type of robot, 50% at 400, 25% at 800 exstra.
    -could use command realays to increase how mush a single AI-Core or sub command node can power.?
    -im unsure of this. might be a bad idea.
AIRetrofits:
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.
    -add this hullmod to all fighters the ship fires. this would be kinda coolness.
