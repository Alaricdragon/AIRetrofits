to do list:
Shipyard:
    issues:
        if i remove the building, the sub-market will vanish. this will destroy all ships in said submarket.
         -solution: add a way to move the ships from the shipyard submarket to the storage submarket.
    not yet done:
        need to get the extra hullmods prepared.
            -(done) set up refrences in data, and in the shipyards 'add hullmods to ship' thing
            - set up the hull mod classes with all there data
            - run tests to make sure everything is working

        AIRetrofit-Aplha:
            -add scaling extra opp to the hullmod
            -and make sure it all works
AIRetrofit:
    -well im on the topic of hullmods, replace the 'oppadd' class with something less blotted
questions:
    how to add an fleet shipyard market thing like storage to an market

    how to make an industry send resources to your supply point
    how to add text prosaically to an item
market:
    (done!)build the framework for all the new buildings.
    (done!) finish making the code to do the market growth calculation.
    (started)design and add industries to produce both advanced and basic robotic workers.
    (done!) create the market growth code for advanced robotic factory's.
    (started)balance pop growth factory's.
        -need to add an negative when an factory has an supply defect / exes.
        -need to put more work into th number of salvage drones an factory produces.
    (not possable?)rebuild the hazard button as designed in market growth

Combatability:
    -(done. not tested)add code to make it so you get the robotforge hullmod/skill, and AIRetrofits hullmod when you have AIRetrofits and dont have said hullmods and abilitys.
Robot Forge:
    -(done.)improve descriptions.
    -(done. not tested)make it so you get the skill after finding the robot forge hullmod.
    -(started)add an option to build people from sub command nodes.

Robots:
    -add an extra part to there description that shows:
        -size
        -crew-power.
        -(this is done for weapons. it can be done here.)
    -change how AI cores work to power them, so an AI core can only control so many robot workers.
AIRetrofits:
    -fix description not respecting configs? or reality...
    -add on the fighter hull type to the crew costs of this hullmod.

AI Market plugin:
    Note: possible solution is to only use one plugin and make it open an dialog with the world, then go from there. dialog is mush easier...
    fix the randomly not working nature of the plugin.
    fix the fact you can click on the plugin when you should not be able to (should be greyed out)
        -when in an sector without hyperSpace transit?
            -might keep this. no reason not to?
        -when an enemy fleet is near by, and is blocking you.
    fix the fact you cant click on the plugin at random times, and need to spam click it to get it to work
        -why?
    fix the fact the plugin dose NOT require the resources it says it dose to work
