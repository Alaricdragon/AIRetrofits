Idea:
    advanced robot types. (requires alpha core in personal robot forge)
        -only built in specal market buildings.
        -2X or more the power of normal robots.
        -worker:
            same size. 2X power.
            I don't know if i like this.
            worker robots are kinda big, although not bulky. they are also very very useful.
            the 2X power with no downsides would make them the strongest of the workers....
            new plan:
            0.75X size. 1.25X power?
            recoded size and increased power.
            concept: they are more streamlined workers. able to do more with less bulky components.
            (1.25 * 1.25 = about 1.7x?)
        -survey:
            1/3 the size. same power? (maybe for when i can remove them, for now, im going with 2/3 size, same power)
            -survey drones already have an large amount of power, offset by an large carry cost.
            -cut the size considerably, for the same or slightly less power is an very good buff.
            1.1 / 3 = 0.3
            (3X power density)
        -combat:
            1 2/4 the size? 2.5X power?
            (1.25)
            2.5X power makes them 25% stronger then marines.
            1.5X the size makes them 0.75 cargo per one.
            this makes them more cost effective, without multiplying there damage per cargo something crazy.
            it results in them being slightly stronger then an marine. something that they should be, being specially built for combat.
            (1.875X power density)

    omega robot types: (requires omega core in personal robot forge)
        6X power of normal robots?
        -Worker
            1/2 the size. 3X the power?
            0.5 size. 3power
            (6X power density)
        -survey
            1/2 the size. 3X the power?
            0.55 size. 4.5 power? (forogt the numbers).
            this is offset by bing very hard to get.
            (6X power density)
        -combat
            2X the size. 10X the power?
            1 size and 5 power. making them 5X as strong as marines
            (5X power density)


    Commodity's:
        price:          base price you pay in market
        export value:   base income you get per unit of output
        econUnit:       the number of items perduced per output
        eU * base value:econUnit * price. for contact missions
