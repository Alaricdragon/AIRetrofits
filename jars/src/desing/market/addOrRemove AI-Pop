concept: the ability to turn on/off the AI pop market condition and effects, at a cost.


current system:
    1 building.
    takes time to build, once built it impudently starts to upgrade?
















old) i take issue to this document. it.. lakes a certain ability.
new plan: wait for the event system. has real consequences, and player choice, instead of just having everything donated to random chance.

how? a population would need to slowly be removed from a world, only to be replaced by another population.
the way i see it, there is 5 ways to do this, with varying results based on if the market is a AI-Pop market or not.
but first, how would this be done?

1) build the intel building.
    -the first building would represent you preparing the market to be purged. that would mean it represents:
        -the gathering of resources, be it units, materials, and information
        -the planing stages of how to preform the purge.
    -the cost would be high?low? with a high?low? upkeep.
    -it would require
        -in both cases, i will make demand illegal on the market, so it has to be smuggled in
        -normal to AI pop:
            combat robots++
            salvage robots+++
            command relays
            supply+++
            maintenance parts+
            robotic replacement parts
        -AI pop to normal:
            marines+
            crew++
            supply+++
            food+++
            heavy weapons+
    -it would begin growing (mush like population dose). this represents how prepared for the purge your industry is. with zero percent being not ready, and 100% being ready.

2) decide purge type (with building upgrade)
    the way i see it, there is 3 type of ways once could chose to purge a population, with 2 variants each, resulting with with different up and downsides
    passive represents trying to hide your actions. active is not trying to hide your actions.
    a) displacement
        -passive:   try to force the population to flee by doing things like increasing rent, making work harder to find, and travel easier
        -active:    forcing the population off world and into the wilds, or onto any ship you can put them in
        -stats:
            time: very long.
            cost: low - mid -> mid -> mid high
            discovery: none -> low -> low
            failure condition:
            failure: population reorganizes and tries to act without your owners leadership. new event starts.
            crit fail:
    c) processing
        -passive:   try to slowly force the population to become resources for you, with kidnapping, and taking undesirables for yourself.
        -active:    try to slowly force the population to become resources for you, by trying to round up the population into processors
        -stats:
            time: mid - long -> long     -> mid
            cost: low to mid -> -mid     -> -high
            discovery: low   -> mid-high -> high
            failure condition:
            failure: population destroys processors. rebels?
    d) extermination
        -passive:   try to kill the population with passive methods, such as arranging accidents, and sabotaging parts of the required instructor
        -active:    try to wage a active war on the world. to destroy.
        -stats:
            time: short     -> mid       -> short
            cost: high      -> very high -> mid
            discovery: high -> very high -> mid
            failure condition: fail to meet demand for to long, or industry gets disrupted
            failure: population rebels. might request outside help


    type a) passive:
        passive means you are trying to hide what you are doing from your population. more hidden is more good.
        passive stats:
            time+++;
            cost-
            discovery--;
            failure results: less likely for population to do extreme acts?
    type b) active:
        active mean you are not trying to hide anything. just get it done.
        active stats:
            time----;
            cost++;
            discovery+++;
