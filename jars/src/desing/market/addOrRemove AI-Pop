concept: the ability to turn on/off the AI pop market condition and effects, at a cost.


current system:
    1 building.
    takes time to build, once built it impudently removes itself, adding / removing robot population m=condition.?

new system:
    requirements: the ability to mess with population composition.
    note: the type types of market i keep talking about are robotic-populations and normal populations.
    2 vareants: one for normal worlds, the other for robotic worlds.

    this building would represent a 'headquarters' for the type of population you in fact don't have on this world.
    the building would make it so:
        -you could get population form sources that the other population type.
        -as you gain population from this, the population composition changes, and so do the imports and exports change
         to match as a percentage of a complete change (like what is caused with robotic population condition)
        -would be possable to cause unrest if to mush of a hostile population type are settled on this would
            -example: ludic population, and robotic population.
            -when this happens, stability will go down. then pop composition of both types will go down, with a corresponding
             negative to population growth.

     3 tires:
        T1: have a small number of the other population type on this world
            -this would limit growth, after about 30% of population composition was of the other type.
        T2: allow any number of the other population type on this world.
            -this would not limit growth, but if the current type of population becomes a minoirity, swaps the two population
             adds/remove the robotic population market condition.
             -if a population type swap accord, this industry would switch to the other type, and act the same supporting the once dominant population type on this would.
             -if the population becomes completely covered in the other type (95%+) upgrading this industry becomes free, and instant.
        T3: actively attempts to remove all of the main population type from the world.
            -can only gain growth from other population type.
            -stability loss well ongoing.
            -more exstram stability loss the large % of the main population type if present compared to the other type.
            -once the population reaches 95% of the other type, adds/removes robotic population condition, and this industry becomes
             'INACTIVE'

    something to keep in mind is what the 3 tires effects would have on the world?
    because people will notice whats going on, eventually.















old) i take issue to this document. it.. lakes a certain ability.
new plan: wait for the event system. has real consequences, and player choice, instead of just having everything donated to random chance.

how? a population would need to slowly be removed from a world, only to be replaced by another population.
the way i see it, there is 5 ways to do this, with varying results based on if the market is a AI-Pop market or not.
but first, how would this be done?

1) build the intel building.
    -the first building would represent you preparing the market to be purged. that would mean it represents:
        -the gathering of resources, be it units, materials, and information
        -the planing stages of how to preform the purge.
    -the cost would be high?low? with a high?low? upkeep.
    -it would require
        -in both cases, i will make demand illegal on the market, so it has to be smuggled in
        -normal to AI pop:
            combat robots++
            salvage robots+++
            command relays
            supply+++
            maintenance parts+
            robotic replacement parts
        -AI pop to normal:
            marines+
            crew++
            supply+++
            food+++
            heavy weapons+
    -it would begin growing (mush like population dose). this represents how prepared for the purge your industry is. with zero percent being not ready, and 100% being ready.

2) decide purge type (with building upgrade)
    the way i see it, there is 3 type of ways once could chose to purge a population, with 2 variants each, resulting with with different up and downsides
    passive represents trying to hide your actions. active is not trying to hide your actions.
    a) displacement
        -passive:   try to force the population to flee by doing things like increasing rent, making work harder to find, and travel easier
        -active:    forcing the population off world and into the wilds, or onto any ship you can put them in
        -stats:
            time: very long.
            cost: low - mid -> mid -> mid high
            discovery: none -> low -> low
            failure condition:
            failure: population reorganizes and tries to act without your owners leadership. new event starts.
            crit fail:
    c) processing
        -passive:   try to slowly force the population to become resources for you, with kidnapping, and taking undesirables for yourself.
        -active:    try to slowly force the population to become resources for you, by trying to round up the population into processors
        -stats:
            time: mid - long -> long     -> mid
            cost: low to mid -> -mid     -> -high
            discovery: low   -> mid-high -> high
            failure condition:
            failure: population destroys processors. rebels?
    d) extermination
        -passive:   try to kill the population with passive methods, such as arranging accidents, and sabotaging parts of the required instructor
        -active:    try to wage a active war on the world. to destroy.
        -stats:
            time: short     -> mid       -> short
            cost: high      -> very high -> mid
            discovery: high -> very high -> mid
            failure condition: fail to meet demand for to long, or industry gets disrupted
            failure: population rebels. might request outside help


    type a) passive:
        passive means you are trying to hide what you are doing from your population. more hidden is more good.
        passive stats:
            time+++;
            cost-
            discovery--;
            failure results: less likely for population to do extreme acts?
    type b) active:
        active mean you are not trying to hide anything. just get it done.
        active stats:
            time----;
            cost++;
            discovery+++;
