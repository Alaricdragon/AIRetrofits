to do list:
    find a way to change hazard pay cost (as the cost right now scales to a worlds hazard rating.)
    fixes all 'potential issues'

current status of market growth:
    it works, mostly. only freeport remains resistant to my efforts. might even work on mods as well.
    implementation:
        2 parts:
            in robotic population condition:
                -removes all removal growth.
                -proceeds to add a negative modifier, equal to all growth that in theory is active on a market.
            in the report market updated listener:
                -hides all growth that is not approved.
    potential issues:
        in robotic population condition:
            -might try to remove growth twice, if the growth was industry / market condition based, and was added before
             this market condition ran.
        in market update listener:
            -this removes all pop growth modifiers from being shown. it makes it hard to see when something is wrong.
current growth modifiers:
    factorys:
        3 tiers of factory's. they provide growth to the world/system/sector they are built on respectively.
        t0:
            provides 3*marketsize * (1 + alpha + improved) to the world its build on
            alpha = .3
            improved = .3
        t1:
            provides 5*marketsize * (1+alpha+hazard+improved) devided between all markers in system (based on market size)
            alpha = .3
            hazzard = .3
            improved = .3
        t2:
            provides 10*marketsize * (1+alpha+hazard+improved) devided between all markers in the sector (based on market size)
            alpha = .3
            hazzard = .3
            improved = .3
    hazzard pay:
        5 * marketsize

    beta core in 'personal salvage robot manufacture'
        12
idea:
    change the way the factorys work so:
        instead of creating robots in the factors, they create 'robot frames'.
            -change exsported / imported comodity
        instead of only being tied to market size, make the share a world receive also be based around 'accessibility' (so its size * accessibility).
            shares = markersize -> shares = marketsize * accessibility
            max size shares: 1 -> 100. (same as size 1 with 100% accessibility)
        (?)make it so world with a high habitability gain an increased amount of growth from there shares.
            -100% hazard = 1X growth. 200% hazzard = 0.5X 400% = 0.25X 800% = 0.125X.
            -0% hazzard = 2X. -100% hazzard to 4X
            -if i do this, i will need to buff robot factorys.
            -justify it by saying its because the robots need to be more specialized? or that the robots are breaking down?

        why? because right now all growth is liner. the same. no differences ever. its -borring-. this is more interesting.
new theory 2:
    -set cost of hazard pay equal to number of robot production building power X 1000.
        -improves the pop growth boost of T1 and T2 robot factorys.
        -provides worlds without robot factorys there own weak robot factory. (only effects them)
        -costs more for every robot factory tier.
    -add an set of buildings for pop growth, upgraded from the robot drone factory:
        T0: basic. provides the world with some pop growth.
        T1: upgraded from T0.
            -provides this world with a good amount of pop growth,
            -provides all robot markets in a system pop growth boost.
                -pop growth boust == marketsize * (base boost / markets sizes to bost). also provide demising returns.
            require an industry slot.
        T2: upgraded from T1.
            -provide this world wih a lot of pop growth.
            -provide all robot markets in sector with an small pop growth boost.
                -pop growth boust == base boost / markets to bost. also provide demising returns.
                -demising returns includes the T1 boost. they are the same boost, yuo cant stack them
                    -pop growth boost = same as the T1 growth boost
                require an industry sloot (or two?)
-replace the population growth speed:
    normal colonly growth rate
        without hazzrd pay:
           base: 9,52
           hazzard: -20,4
           total range: -12,56
        with hazzard pay:
            base: 14,57
            hazzard: 0,4
            total range: 14 , 61
        hazzard pay cost:
            (growth penalty from hazzard + 5) x 1000 cr/ month
            (20,-4) +5 = (25,1) X 1000 cr / month
            (25,000,1,000) cr / month
        (0,15)Accessibility (+1 growth point for every 10% accessibility, or -1 for every 10% below 0% accessibility)
        Instability (-1 growth point for every stability point below 10)
        (4,-20)Hazard rating (-2 growth points for every 25% hazard rating above 100%, and vice versa for below 100%)
        (5,25)Free Port status (+5 growth points, increases to +25 growth points over 1 cycle/365 days)
        (2)Spaceport (+2 growth points)
        (1,6)Megaport (+1 growth point per colony size)
        (1,6)Decivilized Subpopulation (+1 growth point per colony size)
        (+5)Hazard pay (counters the hazard penalty and +5 growth points)
        (?)Larger, non-hostile markets in system (increases rate)
        (?)Shortage of commodities for industries (decreases rate based on shortage)
    basic growth:
        total:(size 1 - 5)
            without growth essentives:
                (4,14)
            with growth essentives:
                (18,52)
        (?)stability based growth:
            -should have an lowish bonus at max stability.
            -should have no bonus at 5 stability
            -should start to apply an harsh negative at low stability
        robot forge based growth:
            -(3)+3 before upgrade
            -(6,9)size +3 after upgrade
            -not upgraded should give an static growth mod
            -upgraded should scale with colony size
        population and infastructor based growth:
            -(size X 1) base growth rate
            -(X)should give population growth based on supplied import of worker drones
            -(-1 growth per missing thing)should give negative population growth based on not supplied import of maintenance parts, and replacement parts.
            -might replace the stability mod
        growth incentives based growth:
            (X)(9,15 at 100% supply)(size X supply% X 3)
            (X)(25,40)((size x 5) + 10 x supply%)
            (X)(23,42)((size x 6) + 5 x supply%)
            (X)(18,36)((size x 6) x supply%)
            ()(14,38)((size x 8) - 10 x supply%)
            this is you pumping credits into something to try and make it grow faster.
            should provide an high growth bonus.
            (maybe) add on some extra worker drone demand to population. this is you importing more drones? then base the growth of that
                -might not make mush sense. your workers are cant just be shipped in from no were. also this is not whats happening.
                -this is not an fun option. it also makes little sence. this is more you paying to have drones grow, but you already do that with imports
            (maybe) add an demand to population for metles, rare metles and heavy machinery based on population size.
                -have population output more worker drones (based on meet demand). have the worker drone output also increase the population growth.
                -effectively this is putting to getter more robots without the proper setups. something used when times are hard, or deadly. such is life.


    passive growth:
        (done)remove all population speed bonuses from everything
        (done)add an population growth bonus for growth incentives
        (done) add an industry that builds population

    active growth:
        (?)add an ability to ship population around.
            -(??) might be redundant. industrial evolution dose this.
            -it should add a growth bonus to an world, and an growth negative to another
            -it should act like an static number of robots are being moved (so at speed 100: -10% growth at size 3, -1% at size 4, -0.1% at size 5)
            -it should add an negative planet modifier on the world that its taking population from
            -it should add an negative and positive modifier on the world its going to.
            -(?)it should be able to down level a population all the way to zero
    max growth:
        this population is not limited to a maximum amount of people on it. it requires no people to want to live here.
        should it be able to grow to an larger word? and if so, how big?
        population limit:
            if it dose it should be based off world size.
            it makes sense that an world could only carry an max amount of workers, before expansion is not possible
            also hazardous worlds should have an smaller cap. as hazardous places are harder to live, requiring more infastuctor per worker.
        stealth limit:
            it gets MUSH harder to hide an world like this if there are to many pops.
            only so many signals into the void, and moving mettle masses, until everyone that comes to trade will say 'wat the hell'
        control limit:
            an reliance on custom made command cores comes with its disadvantages. one of them is that more population means
            harder to control population, as command cores and command relays become overwhelmed by the incoming data.
            could be increased with AI cores, but that might be an bad idea.
