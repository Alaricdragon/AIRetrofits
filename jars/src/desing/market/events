-NOTICE:
    events, as of right now are on hold, until such an time that the new update with the new event system comes out.
    can still design them though.

    note:
        in the furture, there might be an diffrence between an 'event' and an 'situation' were
        'events' are short turm things, or one off events from 'situations'
        'situations' is an ongoing issue that needs solving.

        examples:
            trying to keep your markets hidden from the other factions would be an 'situation'
            an faction finding out, or sending an inspection team to 'investigate' would be an event.
    Events:
        having an robotic world should be a risk. i have no doubt in my mind, that if any faction in the base game were to see they
        they would act. how would depend on the faction.
        how factions would react:
            -Hegemony:          destroy it then hunt you down. if they know it was you at least.
            -Luddic Church:     destroy it and hunt you down. in the name of god?
            -Persean League:    unknown. badly probably
            -Sindrian Diktat:   unknown. badly probably
            -Tri-Tachyon:       take over the market, and use the drones there to there own end. likely not anything
                                they don't know already, but they might learn something (and manage it better then you.
                                because they have an better understanding then you from experience)
            -Independents:      coin flip. if you are in good standing, they might let it slide. they just want to survive.
            -Luddic Path:       you think there sleeper cells are bad now...
                                might also not be believed by other factions. since they cry 'evil' at any tec
                                might be believed by the luddic church
                                    -if so, the church might send out an investigation team to conform
            -Pirates:           would this make a difference to them?

            anti robot:         send saturation bombardments to worlds they know about, and think there are robots on.
                                likely attack you more
            ya robots:          ask for the technology? support you? go 'there can only be one' and attack? blackmail? unknown.
        chance of discovery:
            chance:
                -should be very low for low pop worlds. and the farther you are from an factions systems.
                -should be very hard with getting away with founding an robotic world in someone else system
            AI inspection teams:
                -i say if a team lands and starts tarring up your 'office buildings' only to fid a bounce of computers everywhere (and no people)
                they would have an very high chance to look at your other rooms... and find out the THERE ARE NO HUMANS HERE.
                best to keep them away, if you don't want to be saturation bombardment
                -on the other hand, they likely would have an harder time finding out. there are less people here, so its
                less likely that they would be informed something is wrong. granted, the fact they are never informed of mush
                at all is a bit of a red flag... they would likely still check.

    Invasions and market trading
        another faction taking an robotic market: (by force or by trade)
            there is no possible way for you to hide the fact that your market is AI controlled if they take it.
            if an faction takes this market, and is offended by the existence of bots:
                -they might attempt a purge.
                -if an faction takes this market by force, there is a slim chance they might believe that you know about the robots
                -this faction will become more supisus of you having robotic worlds
            if an faction is not offended by the existence of bots, they might be willing to keep the market intact. they might also:
                -start to found there own robotic colony's. as black sites or other. with all the factors that come into play if they do.
                -give the faction they got the market from an reputation boost
                -give the faction they got it from an reputation negative
                -if they find out because you gifted/sold them the world, they might be grateful in being shared this secret
            if an faction makes landfall(invasion) they will likely notice that something is wrong with there attackers.
                -suspicion that they have robotic population and worlds

        (?)AI uprising
            i don't even know if this is a thing in the base game
            should it happen more? mush more? i don't know.

            there is an new system being added to events. we will see what this can interface when that is out.
