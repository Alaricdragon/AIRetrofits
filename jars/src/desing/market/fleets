   Fleets:
        fleets need to be changed into AI fleets, provided they have an robot world as there 'home'
        they need to:
        -(DONE)add on the hullmod AI-Retrofit
        -(DONE)change there image and names of all AI captions
        -(partly DONE?)replace crew with salvage robots and survey robots in inventory
        -(DONE?)replace marines with combat robots in inventory
        -add new dialog if the ships faction is yours

        -from markets in effect by a 'building that perma installs AI-Retrofits hullmod', have said hullmod instead
        -from markets in effect of an advanced robotic drone factory, need to have the advanced form of robot drones instead.
