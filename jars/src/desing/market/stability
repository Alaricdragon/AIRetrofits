-stability:
    base game market stability acts like there are people on the world, whence why, when times are hard, the government might collapse (decivalize)
    therefore, a population of robots should not be as easy to destabilize as easily, but it should still be possible (complete market collapse, or an failure to keep AI control nodes online)
    thus an robotic markets stability should be modified by the following:
        -an positive modifier, just from being an AI population
    and should be not be modified by:
        -certain planetary modifiers (like having an world full of drugs)
    regarding an complete deciv:
        -should still be possible to do from raiding (robots preparing an defence can be costly, and disorganize the carefully
        organized population. this happens to chaotically it should be able to cause significant damage.)
        -in fact should still happen by loss of supply as well. AI cores cant function, market dies without controls for the drones.

-market conditions:
    -devitalized subpop should act differently (more - stability,no pop growth. the dominion people likely hate AI's and will try to fight them)
    -any drug modifier: should not matter here.
    -holy grown type modifiers: should have risk. it will attract people, if they find out. and they will try to remove the AI's
    -habitable worlds: should provide no changes? (dont know about this one)
    -bi-weapon provide no negatives? (or maybe a defencive bonus. )

-people:
    administrators, bar people, extra.
    -give people new images and names
    -probably don't give them new dialog. to complicated for me
-descriptions:
    -should be modified somehow. don't know how
