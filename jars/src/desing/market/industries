issue:
    almost every building is borring. very very boring. i dont like it.
    i like automated ship installation center, as well as the personal robot manufactures. i also am ok with the robotic population factorys, and the population replacement center
    idea: add exstra function to all industry and markets, eater by making the items they produce useful, or by adding extra function themselves.
    so, in that vain, here are the idea for the 'uninteresting' industrys:
        robotic matnace fasility:
            add a sub market were you can get robotic replacerment parts and robotic matnace pacs for cheep.
            make it so robotic replacement parts to be used to reduce casualties on robots (like, lose 30 - 40% of robot losses as robotic replacement parts, provided they are available.)
            make it so robotic matnace pacs can be used to reduce the supply drain on your ships when your using AI-Retrofits, and make it so they use the matnace pacs instead.
        sub command node prodution place:
            make a sub market were you can bye sub command nodes, and in very limited number, command nodes.
                -command nodes will be consumable items that give you a officer or a admen on use. (or spy with nexerlin?)
        synfetec factory:
            -i.. dont have any ideas. like, what can they even do? maybe crew ships at a cost? maybe?
       Population Replacement Center
            -give this a middle ground. something like, letting it grow population of the other type (robots on a normal market, and people on a AI market)
            -give it a upgrade (or other type of option) that gives it the function of completely replacing the market
                -provide a massive growth penalty well that is active
                -provide options for displacement or purge, depending on what you want to do.
            -make it based on population composition.  so lv 1 of this lets the non main population grow up to lets say 50% of the population.
            -make it so if i reach 90% population of the non document population type, the main population type will switch.
            mmmm. this looks like something for market retrofits to handle, but..
            -let different population compositions interact with each other.

            time:       40 days?

            industry: false
        extra:
            give all ships from same faction AI markets in system an advanced version of AI-Retrofits.
            takes sub command nodes to function
            adds an shipyard to the world that adds an advanced version of AI-Retrofits to ships at an rate of 8/4/2/1 ships per moth, depending on ship size.
            can be improved to 16/8/4/2 ships per moth depending on ship size
        thoughts:
            not an industry. dost not produce income. potentially massively powerfully for player fleets.
            2 large ships an moth + alpha core requirement for the best upgraded ships provides counter balance.
            should have an high cost for an non industry.
        AI cores:
            an idea is to allow AI cores to change the effect of the hullmod on ships built in this shipyard / spawned by the faction.

                - +100% - 150% supply use, depending on % of bonus opp gained
                - +100% repair times.
