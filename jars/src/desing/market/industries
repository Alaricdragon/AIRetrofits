issues:
    -right now all exstra industries only serve to slow down your game, and this kinda sucks.
        -option 1: reduce cost
            reducing the cost means creating the industries first will be less painfull.
        -option 2: make all industries do something cool
            still has the same issue, the market MAKES you make them even if they are usefull.
        -option 3: reduce penalties for not having industries.
            right now, not having anything provides an massive penalty to stability. unacceptable.
            instead reduce the penalty to -1 per item, but only after market at market sizes 4,5,6.
            example:
                at size 3+, -stab from missing maintains parts.
                at size 4+, -stab from missing command relays.
                at size 5+, -stab from missing sub command nodes.
            also proved an boost in stability for having said upgrades:
                +stab from meeting maintains parts.
                +stab from meeting command relays.
                +stab from meeting sub command nodes.

    -right now, there is no 'fun' to be had from an AI market. this might help:
        option 1: add new industries that do new things to an AI market.
            right now, an AI market provides nothing -new- lets change that.
            ideas:
                -add an industry (or building) to produce high tech robots
                    -high tech robots could have 2X power for the same size, but not be producible by the players fleets robot forges.
                    -having this industry could make all ships coming from this market hold high tech robots instead of normal ones.
                -add an industry (or building) to upgrade ships with an free AI retrofit
                    -have this building create an ship storage (like the repair dock) that uninstalls 'AI-Retrofits' (if applicable)
                     and installs 'built-in AI-Retrofits' at an rate of 8/4/2/1 ships per moth.
                    -have this industry make all same faction AI market ships from this system have the 'built-in AI-Retrofits' instead of the normal 'AI-Retrofits'
cost data:
    build cost (number X 5000)

    upkeep (low = 1-5,mid = 6-9,high = 10+)
Industry:
    AI-Ship instalation fasility:
        supply:
            nothing
        demand:
            AIretrofit_SubCommandNode:  (1)
            AIretrofit_WorkerDrone: (3)
        cost:
            build cost: 20 (100k)?
            time:       40 days?
            upkeep:     6?
            industry: false
        extra:
            give all ships from same faction AI markets in system an advanced version of AI-Retrofits.
            takes sub command nodes to function
            adds an shipyard to the world that adds an advanced version of AI-Retrofits to ships at an rate of 8/4/2/1 ships per moth, depending on ship size.
            can be improved to 16/8/4/2 ships per moth depending on ship size
        thoughts:
            not an industry. dost not produce income. potentially massively powerfully for player fleets.
            2 large ships an moth + alpha core requirement for the best upgraded ships provides counter balance.
            should have an high cost for an non industry.
        AI cores:
            an idea is to allow AI cores to change the effect of the hullmod on ships built in this shipyard / spawned by the faction.

                -(cap extra opp at 5/10/20/40 per ship size)
                -cant install robot forge on this ship
                - +100% - 150% supply use, depending on % of bonus opp gained
                - +100% repair times.
            default:
                - no opp cost
                -permanent
                -remove min crew.

        thoughts:
            a lot of new industry might need to be added, for not making AI markets to simple
            most likely, i will make them require the 'robotic population' market condition im using to control all of this.
