issues:
    i have a few issues with the base AI-Retrofits:
        1)AIRetrofits hull-mods power varies to mush.
            on ships with a small min crew, its good.
            on ships with a large max crew it sucks.
        2)AIRetrofits provides no change to crew based fighter casaltys.
            -should it? maybe. defiantly on the alpha version.
    i have a few issues with the built in AIRetrofits:
        1) the alpha core is to strong.
            -the alpha core adding opp feels broken as hell....
            -possable sullution: make the alpha core reduce the penalty of having a AI-Retrofit hullmod depending on the ratio between max and min crew?
    i have a few issues with the current version of hull mods:
        1) there is no way to man a ship you find out in the wasts. i dont like that...
        2) robots take up far to mush cargo on the ship. this is in theory fine, but it does get to be quite frustrating over time.
        3) i have all this exstra crew space, and nothing to do with it.

    so new hullmods:
        1)patchwork AI-Retrofit
            -exstends AI-Retrofit.
            -can be instaled anywere.
            -if you land on a market (and own the AI-Retrofit hullmod) auto installs AI-Retrofit.
            -drops the ships CR by 15
            -slightly increases chance of malfunctions.
            -can not be perma installed.
            -if AI-Retrofit or its varents are installed, uninstall this hullmod.
            -would need to be found.

        2) robotic drone storage:
            -low opp cost.
            -not compatible with robot forge hullmod
            -lugistic hullmod?
            -does one of the following: (2 variants of this hullmod)
            A: replaces a amount of extra crew storage with "robot storage".
            B: replaces a amount of cargo storage with "robot storage".
            "robot storage" is a special storage that only robots can enter.
            every robot uses there own cargo size in "robot storage"
            because it costs opp, the robot storage would be more efficient then normal storage. lets say:
            for every 1 crew storage removed, add 1 robot storage.
            for every 1 cargo removed, add 2 robot storage
            you would need to find this one

    crazy hullmod ideas:
        1) combat robotic lunch bay
            -a combat hullmod
            -would consume ammo (robots).
            -in combat, would fire up to 2/4/8/16 combat robots (of whatever type its set to fire).
            -(a)the robots would: surround the host ship, and try to attack hostiles. would not be hittable by friendly weapons.
            -(b)would act like a fighter bay, consiting of one bay of robots, with limited replacements.
                -would launch 3? drones at a time, with 2/4/8/16 replacements max.
            -would have 3+ varents: 1 for basic combat robots, one for advanced, and one (very very rare) for omega robots.
