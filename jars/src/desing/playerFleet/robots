notes: on the topic of omega robots:
    they are currently unobtainable. this is not something i like. they are really cool.
    so i need to find out ways to get them:
    first of all, they should rare, like i should not be guaranteed to see them in a game.
        -in fact, they should be rare enuth, that people question there existence.
    secondly, they should only be found in limited ish number.
    thirdly, they should be stronger. im thinking off adding about increasing there defence stat by about 3 or 4X, so they would feel invincible.

    so hays to get them:
        1) in robot manufacture, you can make them if you find a omega core.
            - i want to keep this. i like this. its good for business
            -even though you can make as many as you want, it still requires that you wast a dog dam omega core on it.. quite something.
        2) find them at random (in resurce stations, or other same type things):
            -they would need to be -RARE-. like so rare i might never see one.
            -they would need to come in bunches rangeing from 10 to 100 of them.
        3) create a that can allow you to get a limited number of them:
            -the quest would need to be.. something interesting. a boss ship basically.
            -it would also need to be quite rare. the type of thing you might not even find in a game.
            -it would also need a difrent boss for each thing. im thinking something like:
            combat:
                -uses the crazy combat robot launch bay, with omega combat robots in storage. maybe have one and only one omega weapon.
                -a omega class ship? something that's hard to communicate with.. very hard. what on earth would we do...?
            survey:
                -a crazed surveyor. likes to run away, but keeps talking trash about you well they run. you can follow them, or find them again.
                -try's there best to avoid combat, and has a large view range. likes to hide, and uses phase ships maybe?.. mmmm.
                -uses bouth survey ships and phase ships?
                -i like the 'likes to hide thing'. i like that a lot. seeing a random ship bosting out of a magmatic field into a jump point. of them running away into a nebula. entering a transverse jump just as you see them...
                -maybe make it so if you can keep on there tail, for like a year, they turn and fight.
                -change dialog about what is going on depending on if you catch them or if you turn and fight you.
                -have the dialog of catching them be frantic, and fearfull and have them try to flee.
                -have the dialog of them turning to fight you be angry. almost mad. they are not happy with you.
            salvage:
                -some type of strange, possibly broken automated ship. maybe a mix of rearmament and derelict?
                -would not care about you existence. would go between random worlds and asteroids in a part of the sector (were there are no markets around)
                -would have a small sensor profile.
                -if a market were to form in its roaming area, would find another area to hang out in.
                -would have a set home base somewere in the sector, were it would return its loot every few cycles (not really, but it would return to that location)
                -if you were to find its home base, and loot it, it would teleport right in to the system and try to attack you.
                -if you were to find it, before its home base, and win the fight, you would get a quest to go to its home base.
                -the salvage robots would be at its home base.

            -salvage
            -repair conal hypershunt
        combat
            -raid
            -invasions
            -steal a starship
        survey
            -survey worlds.


    3 tiers of each:(size,power)
        salvage:
            T1: 1    ,1
            T2: 0.75 ,1.25
            T3: 0.5  ,3
        combat:
            T1: 0.5  ,0.5
            T2: 0.75 ,1.25
            T3: 1,   5
        survey:
            T1: 1.1  ,1.5
            T2: 0.3  ,1.5
            T3: 0.55 ,4.5

    modifiers:
        power:
            all robots are augmented by the strongest AI core in you fleet, and are penalized when there is none.
            (all modifiers are a multiplayer on the normal amount of power per robot.)
            AI-Core stats:
                none:               0.85
                sub-command-node:   1
                gamma:              1.15
                beta:               1.3
                alpha:              1.45
                omega:              1.6
        defence:
            currently, defence is the same as power, however i might remove or reduce the defence bonus,
            so you lose and have to replace robots more often.
