                        -instant. why not just sue sub-command cores?
                        -long time: make it an effort to build this thing. its massive. are the boosts to AI markets worth it?

                    all officers / admen created like this will have an AI picture and name
                    officers and admins cost just as mush as normal.

                        -maintains
                            i have thought of a lot of things. requiring supply, or credits.

                            cost the same as an normal caption?
                    Admen:
                        -have the ability to add your skills to the admen for extra story points (like in vanilla).
