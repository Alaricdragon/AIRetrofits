changelog for all my changes as i make them so i dont forget again.

v0.7.1:
save compatible with 0.7.
improvements:
    upgraded robot forge description number in the forge selection, so it looks like the rest of the game now.
    gave the op cost per crew from AIRetrofits its own config.
balance:
    *the robot forge felt extremely weak in testing. to the point it was -boring-. this felt better. nanoforge not tested.
    -changed the default robot forge power from 1 power per 500 crew, to 1 power per 100 crew
    -changed the way nanoforges were calculated, so its now caped at the robot forge power from your robot forges.
    -changed C-nanoforge power from 0.025 to 1.
    -changed P-namoforge power from 0.075 to 5.

fixes:
    -changed the way peoples names and pictures at AI markets were changed. it should work 100% of the time now (hopefully.)

v0.7:
-an slight update to robotic workers were they are buffed by having AI cores in your cargo, and weakened slightly when you have none.
-an way to create an market using salvaging robots instead of crew.
 -the new markets include new portraits and names for captions and admen
 -the new markets have some supply demand changes, that should work with all mods
 -the new markets have an completely different set of growth speed modifiers, to be changed latter
 -the new markets will have some general weirdness.
 -fleets spawned by this market type of market, belonging to the faction that ownes it, will spawn with the AI-Retorfits hullmod, as well as salvage and combat robots instead of crew and marinas
  -do away with humons. bad humons. robots will rule muahaha
 -an bunch of missing images. for real its really bad, but i wanna starsector
 -an bunch of disable fetures, to be added in like latter, that add more flavor to this silly silly change. already partly in but disabled for save compatibility latter.
 -and before i forget, you need an bunch of things before your robot markets will have stability. enjoy.
