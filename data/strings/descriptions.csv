AIretrofit_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"A salvage drone. It's about as effective as a normal crew at salvaging, but is worthless at everything else.",,,,
AIretrofit_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"Combat drones have very effective wepons. It's a shame they have an tendency to walk straight into killboxes and other fortifications. Without the flexibility of normal combatants, they must be deployed in numbers to successfully overwhelm a foe.",,,,
AIretrofit_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"A specialized survey drone. It's extremely effective at taking samples from the ground and exploring, much more so than normal crew.",,,,
AIretrofit_CommandRely,RESOURCE,"An AI command node. Used to organize and communicate data between command nodes, without having said command nodes break down from information overload.",,,,
AIretrofit_maintainsPacts,RESOURCE,"Various parts for robot maintenance, for when robotic workers suffer minor damage.",,,,
AIretrofit_SubCommandNode,RESOURCE,"An AI Command Core. While it is not even comparable to something like a gamma core, it's still capable of performing somewhat complicated tasks, provided there is only a small amount of factors to consider. If given too much to do, the core will lag to the point of uselessness.",,,,
AIretrofit_roboticReplacementParts,RESOURCE,A set of easily-adaptable parts to repair robotic workers that have suffered extensive damage.,,,,
AIretrofit_humanInterfaceNode,RESOURCE,"While you can't tell by looking at it, this 'human' is not, in fact a human. It's a robotic worker disguised as one. If no colonist can converse with a visitor, then this will naturally rouse suspicion. This 'person' helps to prevent that by talking to people; about their day, about work, about all sorts of things...",,,,
