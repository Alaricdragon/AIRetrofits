AIretrofit_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"A robot specialized for salvage operations. It is about as effective as a normal crew at salvaging, but is worthless at everything else.",,,,
AIretrofit_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"A robot specialized for ground engagements. Combat Robots have very effective weapons, but slow reaction speeds and poor perception. Without the flexibility of human combatants, they must be deployed en masse to overwhelm the enemy.",,,,
AIretrofit_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"A robot specialized for survey operations. It's extremely effective at taking samples from the ground and exploring, much more so than normal crew.",,,,
AIretrofit_CommandRely,RESOURCE,"An AI Command Relay. Used to organize, filter, and distribute data between Sub Command Nodes well preventing said Sub Command Nodes break down from information overload.",,,,
AIretrofit_maintainsPacts,RESOURCE,"Various parts for robot maintenance, for when robotic workers suffer minor damage.",,,,
AIretrofit_SubCommandNode,RESOURCE,"A simple and somewhat primitive AI core. While it is not even comparable to something like a Gamma Core, it is still capable of performing complicated calculations, provided there are not too many variables to consider. If given too much to do, the core will lag to the point of uselessness.",,,,
AIretrofit_roboticReplacementParts,RESOURCE,A set of easily-adaptable parts to repair robotic workers that have suffered extensive damage.,,,,
AIretrofit_humanInterfaceNode,RESOURCE,"A robot designed to perfectly mimic the appearance of a human being. If no colonist can converse with a visitor, then this will naturally arouse suspicion. This machine helps to prevent that by talking to people; about their day, about work, about all sorts of things.",,,,

AIretrofit_Advanced_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"A utility robot that moves objects with four advanced tractor beams. It is powered by an internal power core doubling as a primary computer. It can project its beams into a cutting edge for tearing objects apart cleanly.",,,,
AIretrofit_Advanced_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"A relatively large combat robot armed with a miniaturized phase lance. Advanced anti-gravity propulsion and high tech thrusters allows a high level of mobility in combat. Limited computational power allows a small level of in combat decision making. This allowing forces composed of this type of robot to avoid things like enemy kill boxes and preform more complicated combat maneuvers",,,,
AIretrofit_Advanced_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"A relatively small robot armed with a number of scanners and sensors, primarily used for planetary surveys. Its advanced propulsion allows it to swiftly react to any changes in its environment, and it is just durable enough to survive most planetary conditions.",,,,
,,,,,,
AIretrofit_Omega_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"The only thing understood about this machine is that it utilizes a combination of rift beams and antimatter blasts to perform salvaging operations. Everything else - from how its propulsion works, to what powers the it, or even where its sensors are located - remains a mystery.",,,,
AIretrofit_Omega_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"A machine segmented into four separate parts that individually move on their own as though they are connected. Its methods of propulsion, information processing and construction are unknown; only its nightmarish combat capability is well-understood.",,,,
AIretrofit_Omega_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"A reconnaissance robot capable of projecting a small-scale shield around itself to protect it from danger. While data can be retrieved from it, the methods it uses to collect that data are not understood.",,,,
