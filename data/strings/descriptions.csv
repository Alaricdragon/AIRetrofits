AIretrofit_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"A salvage drone. It's about as effective as a normal crew at salvaging, but is worthless at everything else.",,,,
AIretrofit_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"Combat drones have very effective wepons. It's a shame they have an tendency to walk straight into killboxes and other fortifications. Without the flexibility of normal combatants, they must be deployed in numbers to successfully overwhelm a foe.",,,,
AIretrofit_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"A specialized survey drone. It's extremely effective at taking samples from the ground and exploring, much more so than normal crew.",,,,
AIretrofit_CommandRely,RESOURCE,"An AI command node. Used to organize and communicate data between command nodes, without having said command nodes break down from information overload.",,,,
AIretrofit_maintainsPacts,RESOURCE,"Various parts for robot maintenance, for when robotic workers suffer minor damage.",,,,
AIretrofit_SubCommandNode,RESOURCE,"An AI Command Core. While it is not even comparable to something like a gamma core, it's still capable of performing somewhat complicated tasks, provided there is only a small amount of factors to consider. If given too much to do, the core will lag to the point of uselessness.",,,,
AIretrofit_roboticReplacementParts,RESOURCE,A set of easily-adaptable parts to repair robotic workers that have suffered extensive damage.,,,,
AIretrofit_humanInterfaceNode,RESOURCE,"While you can't tell by looking at it, this 'human' is not, in fact a human. It's a robotic worker disguised as one. If no colonist can converse with a visitor, then this will naturally rouse suspicion. This 'person' helps to prevent that by talking to people; about their day, about work, about all sorts of things...",,,,

AIretrofit_Advanced_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"temp: smaller, and stronger. 0.75, 1.25. description temp: moves objects with 4 'advanced tractor beams' powed by an iternal power core that is also its primary computer. is able to project its beems into a cutting edge for tearing objects apart cleanly. no attemps to replecate this robotic unit without the assitance of a alpha core has been sucsesfull",,,,
AIretrofit_Advanced_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"temp: larger. stronger. 0.75, 1.25. description temp: a relitively large combat unit armed with a miniturized phase lance, this unit is exstreamly deadly in comparision to a marrine, able to preform flanking and assalts very well. the only things holding it back are its poor defences.  no attemps to replecate this robotic unit without the assitance of a alpha core has been sucsesfull",,,,
AIretrofit_Advanced_SurveyDrone,RESOURCE,"temp: smaller. same. 0.3, whatever the old one had i forgot. description temp: armed with a energy shield to protect it from inviermental damgers, as well as a susacated anti gravity propoltion system, this unit is very good at gliding around a world and surveying all its natrual fetures with its high resolution sensers.  no attemps to replecate this robotic unit without the assitance of a alpha core has been sucsesfull",,,,

AIretrofit_Omega_WorkerDrone,RESOURCE,"temp: smaler. stronger. 0.5, 3",,,,
AIretrofit_Omega_CombatDrone,RESOURCE,"temp: larger. stronger. 1, 5. description temp: What is this? why is it seemingly segmented into 4 destintct parts, and why do they move as though they are connected? how does it move on its own? were are its orders processed? is it alive? am i? the only thing understood about this unit is its truely horrafing combat effectiveness.",,,,
