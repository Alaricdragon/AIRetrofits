Constructed with many independent arms, they are designed to hold any tools that they might need for whatever mission they might encounter, as well as anchor themselves to whatever surface they might require in order to salvage. Controlled from the command ship, they tend to operate very well, but accidents can still occur due to their lack of creativity when in the field. This is barely enough to offset the disadvantages of using salvaging robots in tasks, making them about as effective as normal crew.",

Survey robots are built with the ability to collect samples of anything they find. They're also outfitted with sensors to detect geological activity, as well as complex sensors that are capable of analyzing the land around them for anything from signs of life, to mineral deposits, and anything between. Coupled with a somewhat complex custom AI, this makes them very good at their job.

They are controlled remotely from the command room of your flagship when performing combat operations. Despite the in-theory advantages that the Combat Robots offer, they tend to severely under perform in combat. The robots are slow to react in battle, due to the fact that the command ship must first process most of their movements. They often take seconds to realize they are under attack before returning fire as a result, causing increased losses. The alternative - which is to give them all a primitive AI - is worse, as it results in the robots walking into kill-zones and fortifications knowingly, as well as a lack of coordination causing many to fall to the same hostile before the error can be corrected. The only upside is that they are quite small, being 'only' half a ton in size. Combat Robots are capable of fighting in almost any environment. They're best used in large numbers.",
