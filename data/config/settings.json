They are controlled remotely from the command room of your flagship when performing combat operations. Despite the in-theory advantages that the Combat Robots offer, they tend to severely underperform in combat. The drones are slow to react in battle, due to the fact that the command ship must first process most of their movements. They often take seconds to realize they are under attack before returning fire as a result, causing increased losses. The alternative - which is to give them all a primitive AI - is worse, as it results in the drones walking into kill-zones and fortifications knowingly, as well as a lack of coordination causing many to fall to the same hostile before the error can be corrected. The only upside is that they are quite small, weighing 'only' a single ton, and capable of fighting in almost any environment. They're best used in large numbers.",
