They are built with many arms that are designed to hold any tools that they might need for whatever mission they move on, as well as anchor themselves to whatever they might have to when salvaging. controlled from the command ship, they tend to operate very well, but accidents can still accor do to there lack of creativity when in the filed. this is barely enough to offset the disadvantages of using salvaging drones in tasks, making them about as effective as normal crew.",
